# Tech Frontiers

This is the course website for the CU Boulder [Tech Frontiers](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/academics/tech-frontiers-executive-education) professional development program.

## Getting Started

Before arriving for class, you should get your environment setup on your computer and ensure that you can run python, and the required packages.

If you encounter any issues while following these steps, you can contact adam.wiemerslage@colorado.edu for help.


#### Install anaconda
Anaconda is the package manager we will be using to download our python packages. In order to install:

 - For **Windows** users you can follow the guide [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).
 - For **macOS** users you can follow the guide [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/). If you do not have permission to install in the default directory, your user's home directory should work fine.
 - For **Linux** users, follow instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)

#### Install packages
Our instructions assume that you are using anaconda from the terminal (or windows command line).

We have provided an environment.yml file that contains all of the packages you will need for both courses. In order to install
