Otherwise, if you like to bathe with your baby, you will enjoy it. We found it better than any plastic tub. Even though we bought one plastic tub, one that folds down to be really compact, we never use it because she sometime clunks her head to the plastic sides, NOT REALLY SAFE UNLESS YOU WANT A REALLY UPSET CRYING BABY.

We had decided to buy it after reading these stellar reviews, and even though it cost a little more, we thought we were paying for better quality.  The biggest mistake we made was throwing away the packaging (including the warranty), at a time when we were getting rid of piles of boxes that came with the baby items we had bought online.<br /><br />The Aquatopia looked exactly like pictured -- cute, and was very easy to use, for exactly 4 baths.  It powered off automatically almost as soon as I took it out of the water.  During our son's 5th bath, I noticed there was a small amount of water under the display window.  I took it out of the water immediately, but it didn't power off like it had done previously.  I followed by shaking it, as some reviewers here had described doing, but again it did not power off.  It finally went off on its own after about five minutes.<br /><br />At midnight the same day, in between our son's feedings, we were awakened by a loud, high-pitched sound from the Aquatopia.  I knew something was wrong, but still held out hope this was just a signal that the battery needed to be changed.  When I opened up the battery covers (there were two layers), I found tiny drops of water on top of the battery (bad sign).  After I replaced the battey and put the Aquatopia back in the water, it did not turn itself back on again.  It was obviously that the thermometer had short-circuited.  When I looked under the back cover, I found rust had spread across the entire circuit board.<br /><br />If we had kept the original packaging and warranty, we could have had it replaced.  When we decide to buy another bath thermometer, we will stay away from Aquatopia.",4/17/2010

Not a deal breaker, but I probably would have chosen a different model if I had known that upfront. It is not removable.<br /><br />Second, the light emitted is not as ambient as I'd like. There is a fairly concentrated beam that comes out the top of the light, with less bright beams coming from the sides. Making slightly odd 3-pronged array on the wall with very little spill elsewhere. The outlet in my bathroom is around shoulder-level, so I mounted it upside-down in order to illuminate the sink and toilet. Not ideal, but workable.<br /><br />Lastly, the light sensor requires almost total darkness in order to trigger the light. When I turn the lights off in my bathroom, ambient light from the hallway is enough to keep the nightlight off. It's not until I shut the door or pass a shadow in front of the outlet that it clicks on.<br /><br />Overall it's definitely a safe choice of nightlight, but I wouldn't recommend it.",3/7/2014

When looking to purchase, I was attracted to it's dark wood finish, the fact that it is hard wood, that the ottoman in included with the purchase and that the chair has settings to allow it to recline and not rock.    First of all, the chair is really attractive.  I got it in Espresso which matched perfectly with my Black/Cherry Simmons baby furniture.  Upon trying it out, I was a bit disappointed.  It is definitely a smaller rocker.  I am 5'2\\"" and weigh about 127 when not pregnant.  My husband is 5'7\\"" and about 160 pounds.  This rocker fits us very snugly, but if we were larger people, we would not be comfortable in it.  Also, even though it's supposed to have extra plush padding, the padding is very firm, although it is thicker than some other rockers.  Additionally, it is lacking in lumbar support so it doesn't have the best shape to the back pad.  I've found that adding a neck roll to the lumbar area or putting a pillow behind the pad on the rocker helps this a bit, but still isn't the most comfortable.    Baby is still not here yet, so I've yet to try it's effectiveness as a nursing chair.  I think it'll work fine, but I don't think I'll be falling asleep in it like I did with my daughter's rocker/glider chair (for which I paid less in a local furniture outlet store).",2/3/2010

All in all, I am very pleased with this stroller and can highly recommend it. I'd give the Baby Trend 4 stars, the joovy is a better quality. One more thing, it is quite a bit heavier that the Baby Trend one. But that's because there's more metal vs. plastic on it.

If not, then it's a waste of money. I got this because my 4mth always wanted to sit, but could not sit up completely by herself and she loves to play with toys so instead of me holding her up all the time I got her this instead. We of course put a small long pillow around her since she can't sit up completely yet. As for assembly, it took about an hour and I hurt my fingers a couple of time. The base was very hard to put it and I really don't have the muscle strength. You might get a guy to do it, but as a girl I think any woman can do it too. I first saw this at babiesrus and I compared it with the other saucers. This one had the most toys and a variety of toys too. The toys didn't look cheap and crappy like some that I had seen, even from the same manufacture. Remember you don't want to pay a lot for something that has the same types of toys or just 5 toys on it. I do realize that some of the toys won't do much for my child until she is older because she doesn't know how to push buttons yet. I also heard of complaints from other parents about other saucers that their child's hand, finger, etc got caught and they bruised or one of the toy hit them in the eye and bruised them. So I tested for all of that with the toys and it seem safe. No guarantee of course. Summary, so far no problems with the saucer, so I would say it is a good buy and worth the money because it is not only adjustable to height, but collapsable for travel.",3/5/2005

Particularly once the baby/toddler is in a rear-facing convertible seat with a tall shell, I like being able to glance back and make sure that the child is OK.<br /><br />My vehicle does not have a center head rest, so when we only had one child and her seat was in the center, I would install the Brica mirrors but they flopped and slid without having a head rest for support.  I could not install the mirror on one of the outboard head rests and angle it so that the child in the center positioned seat was visible, and the mounting method for a seating position without a head rest is crummy.  Even when the car seat is in a seating position with a head rest, it's a battle to get the Brica mirror set up properly.  You install it, then run to the driver's seat to check if you can actually see the baby or if you need to change the angle, which requires removing the mirror, trying to adjust the angle properly, and re-installing it!  It is a frustrating, iterative process.<br /><br />We have been generally happy with our Britax Boulevard 70 car seats for our older daughter and when I saw the Britax mirror I decided to give it a try. Talk about simple!  You simply buckle the mirror onto the vehicle head rest using vertical and horizontal straps, then pivot the mirror so that it is properly positioned for viewing from the front seat. There's no need to remove it, adjust it, and re-install it in order to hopefully get a good view.  The mirror itself is clear and undistorted.<br /><br />It has installed very easily and quickly in both my 2010 Chevrolet Equinox and my husband's 2001 Toyota Camry.

Add to the fact that you have to fill it while in its \\""sleeve\\"", which adds another translucent layer, you might as well forget about measuring out quantities.  - It is near impossible to warm up this thing. You cannot warm it with the \\""sleeve\\"" (well, you could, it'd take forever), but you cannot warm it nipple-down without the milk leaking out. You can't warm it nipple-up either, because the stupid \\""petal valve\\"" at the other end will leak out the milk too.    Did the designers of this bottle ever try USING this thing to feed a real baby?",7/19/2009

The serging is even all the way around and well done. It's just a little bit thicker and less stretchy than most blankets which should help it stay tighter. The pattern is slightly &#34;grippy&#34; as well. I have been through quite a few swaddles and the problem with most of them is that they are so stretchy that as soon as baby wiggles around some it gets loose. You want a little grip and thickness.

(i usued to move the handle all the way back with my sons carseat, but this one it is difficult, and actually i don't mind now that i'm used to it.) this works nice with the double stroller, which we use with our 2 year old.. the only thing is, the stroller is very narrow, so the carseat hangs over slightly in the area where the other kid sits, our son doesn't seem to mind, but for a larger kid it might not be comfortable. overall i would reccomend this carseat. the main reason i bought it was to go with the stroller.",1/5/2008

CONS:  I can't really feel the vibrations (when I put them on) in the bassinet sleeping area - but who knows, maybe my baby can.  You can't use the pack and play as a changing table and a bassinet at the same time - meaning you have to take off the changing table apparatus to use the bassinet.  However, while a bit of a con, the changing table fits neatly into the side of the pNp and is also very sturdy and well made.

So many of the more expensive bottles have all these extra parts that are really just inconvenient. If you lose the little extra bits, the bottle is useless. Yet, I can't see the benefit of half of them. I decided to buy these for my baby because I loved using them at school and he's a breastfeed baby so I wanted something that seemed close to the breast. They have worked great for us. He has no issue eating out of them, they are easy to clean and the shape is very easy to hold while feeding. The extra cost of these bottles is worth it. We also have some Breastflow bottles which I do not like at all. The nipple calapses all the time and there is a little ridge along the bottom that the bottle brush cannot reach when I am washing them. I bought the Tommee Tippees to replace the breastflow bottles and I am glad I did.

The crayons that come with the mats are triangular shaped so that they do not roll off the table - another bonus. Ours included a red, blue, green and yellow crayon. They do have a bit of a waxy feel to them, but we haven't tried our Crayola crayons on the mats yet to see if they are more or less compatible with them. I will update the review if we get around to it.    As an extra bonus, I don't feel the guilt that I would if I purchased the plastic place mats because they are biodegradable.    If there was any kids of negative, it would be that sometimes the adhesive backing strips on the bottom may be the teeniest tiniest hard to peel off. Just a warning if you have terrible hand dexterity or hand-eye coordination... Once peeled off and placed down, the mat has always stayed down - even covering the table edge (which my man sometimes still likes to bite down on at times.)    Fabulous product!",5/11/2010

Grandma then transfers the milk into bottles or drop in liners when she feeds my son.  It just seems like too much transferring.  I wonder about lost nutrients, and also having to wash/throw away things.  So I thought these sounded like an awesome answer to my problem.  First time I used them I was on my way home from work and noticed drips from my cooler.  Never did I think a bag could leak like this.  It looked like it was from the seal, although when I checked it, it seemed tightly sealed to me.  But all 4 ounces formed a trail from my small office fridge, down the hall and steps, outside on the sidewalk, an in my car. It was maddening!  I threw the rest of the bags out because I wasn't going to risk that happening again.  And up until that time I had never had a leak from a Lansinoh bag.  I know I was careful to close the bag, but if you have to triple check, then it isn't worth it to me.  I was out at a store and bought the Medela pump and store bags like these.  Then I read those reviews, and they are even worse!  So I will return those and just use bottles and wash them and transfer to my bags like I have been doing.  And by the way, I did just get my first leak from a Lansinoh bag too!  This was a tiny little pin point hole in the bottom and was leaking very, very slowly into my fridge.  I don't know if I caused it from my cooler or moving them around in the fridge. They have that good double seal mechanism so I know the seals are good.

I bought 10 more, because they work.  I started out with a pair of these and prefolds when I first began cloth diapering.  If these had not been so easy and convenient I may not have stuck it out with cloth at all.  I am so happy with these diapers.<br /><br />This is not to say I have never had a leak.  I have had one small one in the month and a half that I have used these.  That being said, I have had leaks with my more expensive, more well reviewed cloth diapers and with disposables.  I don't think any diaper is completely immune from leaks what works for one baby might not work as well for another.<br /><br />I question those that say these diapers caused diaper rash.  The interior is 100% cotton flannel and is very soft.  I wonder how often their babies were changed and what detergent they were using.  Some of the other brands that use mircrofiber are very specific about which detergents you can use.  Kushies is not.  Also, along that vein, cotton does not wick away moisture like microfiber but it is the material that has been used in diapers for  hundreds of years.  Some moms prefer it just because it is natural.  I think cotton versus microfiber also has to do with how often you change a diaper.  My four month old can't stand a wet diaper when he is awake and demands that it be changed almost as soon as he goes.  So, microfiber doesn't make much difference to us during the day.<br /><br />Also, be aware there are several different kinds of Kushies.  The classic is more water resistant than waterproof. Kushies suggests that a cover should be used with the classic during naps and night time.  The ultras have a waterproof outer cover as do the ultra lites.  (The cover on the ultra lites is lighter weight.)  Kushies now have a new diaper the Kushies xp but it is not as widely available.<br /><br />I think one of the real bonuses to Kushies is that they are made in Canada.  I am glad to support our neighbors to the north.  There are some brands still made exclusively in the U.S.A. but do your homework.  Some of the big brands that started out in the U.S. have now shipped some operations overseas which is truly disappointing.<br /><br />I am a Kushies fan and I would recommend them to anyone considering going cloth.",10/24/2012

It is amazingly simple, yet effective product! We have a 19 month old Son who hates being held, loves to walk, won't hold your hand, and gets easily distracted. It makes moving through any busy pedestrian traffic area VERY difficult (i.e. airports).<br /><br />But when we put him in his carseat (in our minivan), he is as content as could be. He'll just sit there, suck his thumb, look around, and enjoy the ride. And this product duplicated that for us, making our airport time very easy. I strapped the carseat to the Traveller before we left for the airport, checked in all our baggage curbside, moved the baby from the carseat in our minivan to the new carseat strapped to the Traveller (I bought a new carseat specifically for the trip -- Cosco Scenera, $39 at Wal-Mart. Seat is skinny enough to fit through airplane aisles!), parked the minivan in long-term parking while the Wife waited with the baby, and came back and rolled him through the airport like a piece of carry-on baggage. It could NOT have been easier. Even getting through checkpoint security wasn't that hard...just took the baby out, unstrapped the carseat from the Traveller, put items on conveyer belt, and walked through metal detector with baby. Reset everything on the other side of checkpoint and kept on moving.<br /><br />The entire time, our Son never made a peep. He really enjoyed moving through the airport like this. Sometimes I pushed him, other times I pulled him and it was just like having a stroller. People in every airport we went to looked at us and loved the product idea. We even ran across a few Moms & Dads carrying their babies who looked as us with envy as we strolled right by...<br /><br />Even on the smallest airplane we went on (an S-80 with American Airlines), the aisle was wide enough to push this Traveller with carseat attached directly to our assigned seats. The only recommendation I can make is to board your plane last; it'll keep impatient people from getting upset. Because once you roll onto the plane, it will take a few minutes to unstrap the carseat, fold up the Traveller and stow it, and then get the carseat properly installed with the seatbelt. I got pretty good at it after our first couple flights. And I didn't even need to put my backpack in overhead storage because there was plenty of leg room underneath the carseat, which allowed me to keep the baby stuff (diapers, wipes, snacks, tablet w/Mickey Mouse cartoons) close at hand. The one downside of all this would be that you must purchase a seat for your Toddler...no way around that. But that's my preference any way...I once flew to Hawaii with my other child in my lap. NEVER AGAIN!",10/31/2013

Our crib is a regular crib that we used for our daughter before our son.  We had no problem putting a bumper on it for her.      I then called the company to ask how to return the item.  It took several attempts, in addition to emails to get a return authorization.  When we finally got one, we returned the item within a week with the RA on the outside of the box, and a printed copy of the email from the company with the RA on the inside of the box.  I then headed straight to Babies R Us and bought a brown one that fit perfectly!    It's been ONE MONTH since I mailed the box, and I've emailed at LEAST every other day.  I still have not gotten my refund!      Awful, awful company.",3/11/2010

At first, I wasn't sure what I was going to do with them.  They are almost too big to fit on the short side of a crib.  It would be a little saggy if hung there.  So, I walked around the house trying to picture them somewhere else. I decided to tie both of them to the railing of my stairs to hold hats, mittens, and scarves.  It works great for that.  Three people now use these two bags to hold tons of winter gear.  It looks cute and takes care of the usual tangle of winter gear that used to clutter the bottom of the stairs.  Now that spring is coming, I'm wondering what to use these for.  I'm thinking of keeping one on the stairs to hold flip flops, etc.  One I think I will use on the long end of the crib to hold toys and especially stuffed animals.<br /><br />The only down side it that it became faded and worn looking after one washing.  Still usable, but looked aged right away.  Plus, the ruffles needed steaming.  Still, a &#34;Recommend&#34; in my book.",1/13/2014

That's why they get two stars.  The bad?  They are too big to be functional swaddlers (my baby loves being swaddled, but not with these, this is baby #3 so I am a good swaddler, too).  The price is crazy for what they are (sheets of muslin fabric). I bought several sets of these while pregnant with this baby.  Since she is our last, I wanted to spoil her and myself.  Given all the rave reviews, I thought these would be so great.  They just aren't our thing.  We use Halo sleep sacks, the miracle blanket, and the baby morgan blankets we had from before (bright future, jc penney).  All those work better and make her and me happier.  I do highly recommend Aden and Anais's other product--the burpy bib.  Those have been absolute lifesavers for me.  Buy those for yourself today.

It took me a bit to figure out how to connect the ends or two of these units together and I am still not sure how you remove a panel or move the gate section. The color is much better than a thought it would be. I read about removing screws. I did this but didn't want to force anything. I couldn't find a video or any additional explanation on North States site about this. I did a search for reviews that explained how to do this with no luck.<br />The removal of the posts to connect the ends entails unscrewing the top piece using the post plastic grip with Lock and Release arrows on it. Pull it down this plastics grip. It is spring loaded and allows enough room to force the post out. Once this is done remove the bottom piece by turn and pulling up it rest in place. Then place the side with the top and screw side over the other gate side. Push them into place. The post then goes in the bottom first; just place the bottom hole over the screw; and move the top plastic grip piece down again and force the top into place. Tighten as needed and you are done.<br />The bottom has rubber grommets to protect hard wood floors and prevents the gate from sliding.  I choose this model for its weight and didn't want our little guy to be able to push it over or move it easily. This unit is robust enough that we shouldn't have to worry about that for some time.<br />I like the gate operation. Not only having a button to push but also lifting the gate up to move it helps prevent it from being opened. It also closes on its own if not opened all the way.<br />I would recommend this unit. It is versatile and can be used in a number of configurations.,3/4/2012

I found a bumble ride at a consignment shop but was quickly disappointed by how flimsy it felt and again how poorly it maneuvered. So when looking for my third and hopefully last stroller, I wanted something with high quality materials that felt sturdy, had a well proportioned storage basket, was light enough for me to lift with one arm, easy to open and close, attractive and easy to clean,  but MOST importantly, easy to maneuver both on cement and off-road, like at the playground or park. I researched extensively and was debating both the city mini and the B agile. The City mini had somewhat better reviews and there were a lot of complaints on the B agile regarding the seat back not being upright enough. So I went with the city mini in sand. AND I AM IN LOVE!!! This stroller is so sturdy and well made...top notch quality! It is super light, even for my whimpy arms and it opens and closes so easily. Even though the lock won't usually automatically latch when I close it and I have to click it closed, I could care less because everything else on this stroller is so perfect. It rolls and maneuvers like a dream....in and out of aisles in stores, on the street...so smooth. I even had my 45-pound, 5 year old sitting in the stroller while holding my 7 month old on my hip and had absolutely NO problem pushing the stroller one-handed through the mall. And it looks great too! I can not recommend the city mini enough! And FYI I am 5' 5\\"" and have not had any problem with my feet hitting the brake bar and the handle is the perfect height for me, even when I wear higher shoes. I also recommend getting the child tray and the parent console for the handle. Both are excellent quality. Great how the tray swings out too.

It has all features of my dream umbrella strollers --  a Peek-a-boo window, large canopy, generous foot rest, all wheel suspensions, adult cup holder, rain cover, high seat-to-canopy, carried strap, and deep recline seat. What would you expect more for an affordable umbrella stroller? and Why do I rate it with a 2 stars? Here are the reasons.<br /><br />When I first received the package, the first thing it disappointed me was the manufactured date. It was printed on the box. It was manufactured in 2010 which was during the recalled period. This stroller was recalled because of a brake issue. I believed I'd get a new one with the problem fixed, not the one during the recall period. The stroller has an attached warning sign, but the brakes still aren't engaged with the click sound( the issue wasn't fixed).<br /><br />Peek-a-boo window : I ordered the black canopy one, the black color of the peek-a-boo cover was printed on the peek-a-boo window(clear plastic). I guess it may come from the fact that the stroller has been kept in the storage for so long so that the color on the fabric attached on the peek a boo clear plastic. Well... another defect.<br /><br />Large canopy : The canopy is large.. yes.. but it doesn't really give any coverage for morning and afternoon sun because the canopy is located so high so that  my son head is much lower from the canopy and the light shines directly on his face. (that sun visor doesn't help at all because it's too narrow.) The canopy was also misshape and has slope on the top with full extend.<br /><br />Foot rest : This is the feature that I like the most because it serves the purpose. I have to bend it down every time after unfold though.<br /><br />All wheels suspensions : It does give a smooth ride. That why I added a star.<br /><br />High seat to canopy : The canopy kept tickling my hands when fold up and I felt too far a way from my DS. I hope the canopy was heightadjustable.<br /><br />Carried strap : Yes, good to have a carry strap. I prefer lifting the stroller using my arm under the handles because it's very very heavy (my husband said so) to carry it by the strap. Beside the weight, I couldn't walk normally when carrying it by the strap because my leg kept hitting the stroller behind (I'm 5'6\\"").<br /><br />Deep recline seat: I like the deep recline.. but hate it when I have to pull it up again. It's feasible to pull the string without pushing my child back forward first.<br /><br />The maneuverability of this stroller is not good, it's hard to turn.. must use two hands. I feel it's quite heavy when turning. My child is only 22 lbs.<br /><br />The seat back height on Britax's website is 18.5 inches... I measured it myself and it's just barely 18\\"". My child is a tall kid, he is currently 33\\"" (15 months) and his head already at the top the seat.<br /><br />oh.. one last thing, the handle of the one I got was defected. The finger curves on the left handle was faced outward.",6/27/2012

Once the Baby was born, we used it a lil here and there. Since the Baby slept in our room at night we didn't need it at night.   Once he was 3 month, we started putting him in his room and started also using the monitor.  We loved that it had two parent units, that way you had one downstairs and one upstairs.  As long as you don't have to sleep while you use it it is great!!!  Once you go to sleep at night it will keep you up.  It loses the connection all the time. The click sound will keep you awake.  We spend a couple nights without it, but that is not what you bought it for.  We called the company and they said it happens quite a lot.  So we went to the store and exchanged it.  The design is nice, it is small and you can take it with you when you go some place......  If you don't need to use it every day GREAT thing.

The under storage isnt the biggest one ive seen but I can fit a large diaper bag my purse and several sweatshirts orcwinter coats under it at one time so it does hold a lot.

The reason, as two other reviewers have mentioned, is that the toddler cannot retrieve the blocks on her own, as the rubber flap on the bottom is too heavy for toddler hands to pull the pieces through.  (It's difficult for adults, too, but for a different reason: unless you have really tiny hands, it's hard to fit your hand inside to pull them out.)  Toddler and I have tried to do this as a shared effort:  she sticks her hands inside and brings the block up to the opening in the flap, and if I manage to coordinate my hand just right, I can put one finger through one of the shape holes and give it enough of a push to get it through the flap and free it into her hands.  But this requires great coordination on my part and great patience on hers, and as often as not she gets frustrated and gives up before I can maneuver it into her hands.

In those few days we think we heard the Snuza Halo going through its vibration mode as it was supposed to when are baby paused breathing. Our baby was never motionless for the 15 seconds it takes to alarm but on a couple of occassions when we forgot to turn if off after taking it off his pants to change his diaper, it alarmed after 15 seconds as it should have sitting on a table. We plan to resume using this as soon as our baby is off the hospital's digital monitor. My plan is to use this for a year because our child is high risk. It is very compact so it is not in the way at all.<br /><br />Update after 6 months of use: As I outlined in a review of the Snuza replacement battery, battery life lasted about 2 months each for the original Snuza battery and just slightly less for the first replacement battery (FDK) and then dropped off steadily until at 5 months the replacement Snuza brand battery lasted 2 weeks and the replacement FDK lasted 2 days. So we called it quits on the Snuza Halo at 6 months. My complaints are the Snuza started drawing down batteries faster with Snuza age and battery size is very non standard and despite attempts to order a Sanyo battery adverstized on Amazon, that Amazon seller and Batteries Plus only carried an FDK battery which didn't last as long as the Snuza (see my Snuza replaement battery review). Despite this, I would recommend the Snuza again as it gave us great piece of mind. It did work as on occassion it came off our babies waist and we awoke to the alarm. I also heard it vibrate on occassion before we moved our baby out of our room. Not sure in those cases if our baby truly had stopped breathing for 15 seconds and the Snuza stimulated him back or not, but it wouldn't surprise me since he displayed sleep apnea on the hospital monitors and in listening to him breath when sleeping. Hopefully he would have began breathing on his own but I liked the vibrate stimulation prior to alarm mode. So I still recommend this product despite it only lasting 6 months. These were the crucial months when we needed the monitoring after 3 months of him stopping breathing and needing stimulation in the hospital as a 3 month premature baby.",5/20/2012

I need to adjust the pad slightly every time I put my son in his seat, but it's not a big deal.

This stroller is fantastic! It's the cutest thing ever. I just put one of the many receiving blankets I got for my daughter between the wheels and the canopy like another reviewer mentioned, and I don't forsee any problems with it getting dirty. The hidaway cupholder for the child is convenient, and there's a little pocket next to the seat to store a pacifier, snack, or toy.

We had a hard time finding a compact stroller that we could use without kicking the wheels (I am 5'6\\"", my husband is 6'1\\"") but this is perfect. Tall enought that we don't have to hunch over at all. There is a pro and con to the storage basket, depending on your own view. The basket is hard to access from the back if the seat is reclined, however the sides of the basket are semi-low, so I can get into my diaper bag easily through the side. I don't carry small items, so the low sides aren't a problem for me. If you do carry small items, you'll need to make sure they are secure so that they don't fall out.

It is much more sturdy than the flimsy stuff I'd found at the local 'R Us store.  We purchased three locks and have had two of them installed so far for about two months.  That being said, you need to make sure the toilet lock snaps back into place after closing the toilet lid.  It does not always do so on either of our toilets, but we have the padded toilet seat and lids.  Also know that most toilet seat and lids have a little white plastic cover that goes over the screws that attach the lid to the toilet.  You will have to remove those; they won't work with the toilet lock.<br /><br />Also, you need two hands to open the lock- one to push the button in and one to move the lock back.

Once my son learned to go around it he just got faster and faster as time went on. He would happily spend 20 minutes in this, playing with the toys and going around and around. Eventually I started placing handheld toys on the table top for him to pick up and teeth on and carry with him as he walked around the table. He could practically run around this thing before he could even crawl. One warning...this may encourage early walking, so if you're the type that wants a late walker, you might want to skip this one. My son was walking at 10 1/2 months, though his twin sister was a month behind him and she used this too. She is less active and didn't seem as enthralled with it as my son was.

She LOVED it, and over 2 years later, she still carries \\""gator\\"" with her everywhere!  I've honestly never seen a dog so attached to a toy as she is to this gator!  She has tons of toys, but she only goes for this gator, everytime!<br /><br />This toy makes a great dog toy because of the safety standards employed by good manufacturers of baby toys.  Most dog toy manufacturers are lax because they can get away with it, so the toy is inferior (despite being expensive) and ends up being destroyed quickly.  Baby toys with crinkles, rattles and squeakers are great for small dogs, and you can usually find them for great prices second-hand.  But when you need a replacement for a favorite toy, Amazon is the way to go!<br /><br />Anyway, after 2 years of dragging this toy with her everywhere, poor gator is on his last legs.

The stroller weighed in at 22 pounds.     The color is gorgeous - it's a bright happy red.  It makes quite a statement and fellow parents seem to admire it.  It steers like a dream indoors and outdoors.   You can literally push it with a finger. The front wheels rotate 360 degrees so it turns on a dime. It accommodates children up to 50 pounds and 40 inches.      It accepts the following car seats: First Years I450, First Years I470, Graco Snugride, Snugride 32, Snugride 35, Chicco Keyfit and Keyfit30.  It comes with a bumper bar, a parent console and a car seat adapter in a cute black bag.     Dimensions:34.5 x 23.5 x 41 inches     Here's a summary of the pros and cons:    Pros:    Easy to assemble (clear instructions)  Three positions - front facing, parent facing and bassinet mode  Reasonably priced  Steers like a dream - you can push it with a finger  Very cool-looking  Accepts various car seats  Seat can be removed to be used as a snap-n-go type stroller frame  Easy to fold and unfold  Easy to rotate the seat between positions  Basket is huge and easily accesible   Feels sturdy and stable  Easy to adjust harness (easy to close and open as well)  One-handed steering  Comes with parent console which can hold drinks, keys, cell phone, bottles  Seat can be pretty upright or very reclined  Adjustable legrest  Extendable canopy  Mutiple recline positions  Wheels feel substantial and well made for non-air tire wheels  Adjustable leg rest      Cons:    Seat could be deeper (it would not be a good stroller for really hefty/big kiddos)  Manual says basket should only hold 5 pounds (although I have put lots of groceries in mine)  Seat is made out of plastic material, not fabric (fine by me - easier to clean)  Harness could be more substantial  Somewhat wide fold with seat (I did not fold it without the seat)  Canopy is somewhat limited  Stroller will not last past age 3 unless you have a small/short child      The fold is not as compact as an umbrella fold, but is more compact than the fold of an air tire stroller.  I did notice that the back wheels seem to wobble a little in rougher surfaces, but the movement does not affect the steering or smoothness of the ride at all so it did not bother me. The wheels are large enough to ride over bumps in the sidewalk and the stroller does not get stuck at every bump and crevice.  In my opinion, the ride is pretty darn smooth for a non-AT stroller.  The stroller seems very stable.     The seat has 3 recline positions (bassinet/flat, reclined and upright).  I would probably add a blanket or a snuzzler for a newborn when using the bassinet to make it more comfortable    I took the stroller to a nearby drugstore and loaded the basket. Tons of room. Very happy with it. It steered beautifully among the aisles and my son seemed happy to be higher off the ground (compared to our other strollers).      All in all - I would say you can get great bang for your buck by getting this stroller for an infant and using it until the LO is about 2.5 or 3 years old (depending on height)!  It will not be as smooth a ride as an air tire stroller but is a great alternative to an umbrella stroller or traditional stroller.  It is also a good alternative for parents who want the parent-facing feature without having to spend lots of money on a Bugaboo or similar stroller.    I would definitely recommend it to friends and family! Love it so far!    ETA:  The wheels are a bit squeaky after use outside, so you will need silicone spray. First Years will have to work on this issue.",5/17/2010

There are too many things with the stroller that keep resorting to me deciding that my overall thoughts are \\""it's okay\\"". The stroller is roomy for baby, I like the rear facing option, there is nice storage up top, it's easy to open up and fold back down, it's a great price coming with the car seat and it's good quality. However, the storage basket underneath doesn't offer enough storage. Also, when you're pushing it out off an area that isn't paved it's very very difficult to push. It's also extremely bulky in the trunk. Some trunks are almost impossible to get it into. We ended up buying an umbrella stroller too and using that more than this because of a lot of those problems.<br />I do very much so like the car seat though. As long as you completely read the instructions and follow exactly (I took a car seat class at the fire-station which really helped me understand some of the techniques the instructions explained versus how you'd think to use it; it's true when you read all the baby stuff in pregnancy explaining that car seat instillation is not as simple as you think), then it really keeps your baby completely safe. I really can't say enough good things about the car seat and how great I feel/have seen it be for my baby so I do highly suggest looking for a different stroller system but this same car seat. My only con about the car seat is I just wish it was convertible so we wouldn't have to look into replacing it within/around 1 year of baby's life.",9/8/2013

We had been using a Graco tandem double stroller but we thought that the side by side would be better for the following reasons: <br />- size/weight:  we were driving to FL so this stroller folded smaller than the Graco <br />- orientation:  in the front back stroller, the twin in the back is at a clear disadvantage in terms of view - and the twin in the front is constantly being kicked. <br /> <br />In the store, the Aria Twin stroller could practically turn on a dime - rather than the wide turns that I needed to take with the tandem double.  It seemed roomy and my twins liked being next to each other - so we bought it even though the price was high. <br /> <br />After only this 5 day trip, the following items are already broken: <br />- snack trays won't stay down in the locked position - my twins are constantly lifting them up and pinching their fingers when they put them down.  We have tried everything but they won't stay locked in place. <br />- the basket underneath \\""drags\\"" on the pavement if you put anything heavier than a sweater in it.  As a result, we have to carry everything. <br />- the lever that you need to slide to collapse the stroller fell off somewhere in Disneyworld.  Now, we need to stick a pen or other object in the slot to get the stroller to collapse. <br /> <br />Every though its hard to fit places with a side by side stroller, I like that my twins are treated \\""equally\\"" in it (and equal is very important to twins)...but clearly this was a waste of my three hundred + dollars.

We travel a lot and love having the travel bag to haul our carryon bags in through the airport to the gate, traveling is very manageable! With the recent addition of a new baby, I have been torn on selling this stroller to get a double. I purchased a sit and ride board with seat for the bugaboo to try to make it work (and my daughter finds it fun to ride behind the bassinet) but unfortunately she still needs naps too and this setup isn't good for day trips with both children. Along with this stroller I strongly recommend the cup holder, bugaboo organizer, and umbrella (if you live in sunny/hot or rainy weather it allows better airflow than the rain cover and a sunshade).

And how much my daughter loves it.  We started using it when she was 6 months (at first without the tray), and while she was still a little wobbly at that time with sitting it supported her well and we are continuing to use it now that she is 11 months.  I feel that this chair actually improved her abilities to sit upright and we practiced in it a lot until she was a pro-sitter at 7 months.  <br /> <br />I love that the cover is washable and the double-removable tray attachment is fantastic.  This chair is also very narrow and I LOVE that!  Many of the other highchairs are so incredibly WIDE.  This chair is very easy to clean and maintain and was very easy to assemble. It is also VERY sturdy I have run into it and instead of knocking it over I get a bruise ;-).  I really recommend this chair, especially if you are looking for a wooden high chair that provides some of the modern utilities (like a plastic dishwasher safe tray).  She also doesn't disappear into it as some other high chairs seem to \\""smother\\"" the child.  In this chair she sits tall and happy and matches the height of our dinner tables so we can all eat close together! <br /> <br />I love the little storage compartment underneath it.  I keep wet wipes and bibs there so that is very nice.  I like the cloth cover but have noticed that they've switched it to a wipe down plastic which would be even better (our cover did stain and the velcro didn't like the wash too well). <br /> <br />I must point out to other reviewers that I feel this high chair, (as well as most other high chairs), are meant for a baby who SITS (so if you are beginning solids early at 4 months it probably isn't good for you). <br /> <br />I disagree with some of the other reviews about growing with this chair.

My husband figured it was time to get a toddler seat, but he was very picky about what it looked like, since it would mostly be in his \\""race\\"" car. I saw this one at the store, in red and figured he would like this one best, since the color format looked a little like a racing seat, which we have in the car. The ONLY problem I had with the car seat with getting the base off the seat...which involves pulling out a metal bar. But it took me one look to know that it would be easiest to use a screwdriver. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure this car seat out. It took ME no more than 20 minutes to put the car seat in the car. Only problems I had was MY car's seatbelt locking up while I was pulling. The car seat is more snug in the seat than her infant seat ever was. <br /><br />  <br /><br />  For those who truly have had a problem installing this car seat into their car, FIRST: read the manual first... SECOND: It only takes 1 person to install the seat...   THIRD: Adjust the straps with your infant in the seat, before you install it in the car... FORTH: It's just as snug with the seatbelt, than it is with the LATCH...if you have that big of a problem with the LATCH system being too short in the rear facing position, use the seatbelts! FIFTH: Give your kid a toy if you have that big of a problem fastening the seat belt (if they are fussy)...they'll calm down and you will be able to buckle them in without hands flying in your face. SIXTH: USE A SCREWDRIVER...see above! SEVENTH: They sell seat covers for your interior fabric/leather, to protect it from carseat...buy it! All car seats will leave a mark! EIGHTH: The convertable car seat is not truly made to move around like an infant seat...if it was they would have made carrying bars on them. Use two hands, hold the front of the seat and hold the hole in the back... NINTH: The manual is only thick because it's in two languages, and because it's a convertiable seat. There are plenty of settings you need to know, in order to use the entire seat for ages 1-toddler age. TENTH: The 5th point harness is fine. To unlock it, push in the button that says \\""PUSH\\"". It made sense to me.<br />  This seat is awesome. It may not be made from a big manufacter, like Graco and Evenflo, but with all the research I have done of seats, this one is best...especially for the price and the length of time you can use it!",2/16/2005

I am very petite: 4'11\\"", 98 pounds before getting pregnant.  This review is for the XS Baby K'Tan.<br /><br />I bought my Baby K'Tan upon recommendation from my local baby store.  I was committed to \\""wearing\\"" my baby as much as possible.  Not only did we buy the K'Tan we also bought the Ergo and inherited a Baby Bjorne.  I started carrying my son when he was 8 weeks old.  We didn't want to buy the infant insert for the Ergo (more $$$) and he was too little for the Baby Bjorne.  The Baby K'Tan seemed to swallow him up.  I was constantly shifting him around so he would not get lost in the K'Tan and it was never a guarantee that he would enjoy being in the K'Tan.  I would put him in, and if he wouldn't protest, I'd walk around the house with him or go for walks until he did protest.  I will say we didn't use it much those first six months.  We started using the Ergo when he was about 4.5 months old and the Baby Bjorne shortly after that.<br /><br />Fast forward to 7 months old.  The K'tan had gotten lost at the back of the closet and one day I found it.  At 7 months he was lighter than average (17 pounds) but longer than average (28\\"").  That's when the K'Tan became useful.  We were getting out of the house alot and the K'Tan is fairly easy to get off and on (I find trying to get that back clasp on the Ergo impossible!).  Now that he's bigger, I've found it much more useful.  We alternate the K'Tan with the Baby Bjorne (which my husband loves), so I would say it just depends on what feels good to you.  Being petite, I find that many of the structured carriers are too long for my smaller frame, but the K'Tan is perfect.  Besides, having a couple of baby carriers has been helpful.  We leave one in the car, one in the house, and I tuck the K'Tan in the diaper bag so that when my son is tired of being in the stroller, I can tuck him in the carrier for a change of environment.",4/26/2012

The graphics are cute and it feels solid. The projector seems bright but we didn't test it on a ceiling yet. Frankly, I don't understand the complaints from people about the projector not doing more or not having more slides. I think the point is for it to be repetitive and a little boring since the goal is for them to fall asleep. You want them to be excited and entertained you might as well turn on the television. I also like that you can pull it out of the base. The FP aquarium soother batteries were so hard to change--being able to remove the unit makes that a lot easier.    The biggest problem with this soother is the sound quality is horrendous. It's tinny with vibrations and static sounds. I think my expectations are fair--I'm not looking for the Philharmonic here--but nothing should sound this bad. The FP aquarium didn't sound like this. We're going to give them a second chance and exchange it for a new one. If the next one is the same, we'll be looking elsewhere for a soother.    UPDATE: Amazon's return was amazing. They shipped a new one before we'd even sent back the old one. The new one works fine and has good sound. Must have just gotten a bad one. My little guy (18 mos) LOVES this thing. When it's time for bed I say \\""Let's go find the zebra\\"" and he hops up and heads up the stairs.

Pros:  Backpack feature - it feels really good as a backpack and the straps are placed fabulously so that they didn't slide off my shoulders at all.  Zipper Closure with Flap - I love that you can zip the bag closed and also throw the flap over so that explorative kids can't get in and dig out all of the goods  Lots of pockets - there are lots of pockets on this bag so you can keep most things separated.    Cons:  Not enough space! - even though this diaper bag is huge, I wasn't able to fit in everything that I would have liked to fit.  Pockets are not very useful: - The 2 front pockets have very small openings so even though you can stuff a few things in, they are hard to get into.  Likewise, there are large pockets on both the front and back exteriors, but once you fill the bag, they are rendered useless because there is no give so you can't fit anything in unless it is totally flat.  The bottle pockets are nice and deep, but once again the openings are not very big so they really are limited to basically bottles or similar sized objects.  The openings are too narrow to dig for anything shorter.  There are 4 good sized pockets on the interior, but once you fill them up there is very little room in the bottom of the bag so anything else that you put in the bag must be stacked on top of these.  Shape:  It is tall and narrow.  This is great for the back pack feature - feels fabulous and slender on my back.  But everything has to be stacked on top of each other so I was constantly pulling things out and digging around for what I needed .  Granted, I do tend to pack a lot of stuff, but no more than you would need for a full day out (diapers/wipes, spare outfit, jacket, some food, wallet, 2-3 small toys).  Magnetic Closure  - It is a weak magnet.  It works fairly well when the bag is only moderately loaded, but if you have it filled up the magnets aren't strong enough to find each other.No handle: Other than the messenger and backpack straps there is nothing to pick this bag up with.  I'm constantly wishing it had a small handle that I could grab when I need to move it just a little ways.    I love the style, love the look, love how it feels as a backpack.

This clip helps to prevent kids from sliding out from under the seat belt and also hold the lap portion of the belt across the child's upper thighs. It installs in a similar fashion to moving the crotch buckle and is place able in whichever slot in closest to but not under the child (for frontiers). My child at first was a little confused on how to use it, but after a couple times he got the hang of it. Its length is adjustable so you can get it to the perfect length which is even with the upper thigh. It shouldn't pull the seat belt into their thighs, but rather hold it so that it runs across their thighs. The most important thing is to make sure the belt isn't across their stomach.This is the newer version of the Secureguard clip (compared to the old red one) that seems to be minimally different.I can't tell much of a difference besides this one being black. The seats this is approved to be used on (crash tested and safe) are &#34;FRONTIER, FRONTIER Canada, FRONTIER 85, FRONTIER XT, FRONTIER 85 SICT, FRONTIER XT SICT, PIONEER 70, FRONTIER 90, FRONTIER CT, PINNACLE CT, PINNACLE 90, PIONEER, FRONTIER CLICKTIGHT, and PINNACLE CLICKTIGHT&#34; (from Britax website).

She loves it; she doesn't balk at using it and I've notice her just holding it against a spot where a tooth is emerging for a minute or so before handing the brush back to me and running off happily. It comes with a rubber (bristle-free) head just for teething/gum massage. I've had it for a few weeks and it's absolutely perfect.",8/18/2011

I did not experience this with my first. When my youngest would be done eating, I honestly would wonder if any food got into his mouth as it would be all over his clothes, on the highchair seat, or the floor. I needed to figure out how to save his clothes, since a traditional bib was not doing justice. In the summer, we would take off his shirt but food still would be on his shorts/diaper and with winter, we needed something better. This bib rocks! The neck is high up therefore the food does not sneak through. There are sleeves, which can be a pain to get it on when he is hungry and wants food now, but saves the shirt! I can fold it easily into the diaper bad. I also wash it under the sick and let it hang so it is dry by the next meal. When he masters eating, I will use this bib as a painting smock.

This is an offering for those of us who just don't find a way to justify $200.  However, there is truth in the old adage &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  The simulated video quality in the product photos is crystal clear.  In reality, the picture quality on this monitor is grainy.  This is ok because I don't need to see every detail; I just need to know when my little one is awake.  With the video turned on, the battery lasts only a few minutes, so plan to keep the charger with you as you move between rooms.  The screen constantly blacks out and refreshes.  This is just more annoying than it is problematic.  And even when you don't move the equipment, the device seems to lose connectivity to the base and you get a loud and obtrusive beeping alert.  My default action is to pull the battery to shut if off before it wakes up the baby...and the neighbors (not a big place.  shared walls with neighbors).  And the base has a blinking green light when it is on and broadcasting.  We have to wait to turn the base on until after the kid has fallen asleep, which is ok, but if he wakes up and sees it he will not go back to sleep.  He stares at it.  Unblinkingly.  Creepy.<br /><br />If you have a small budget and a small place that will not have many obstructions between your base and monitor, this should suffice.",2/13/2015

Few others points prospective customers should be aware of:    -- The Tray table is way too small for a growing baby who is going to play with his food on the the tray. I expect more stuff on the carpet than the tray!!    -- The design is good but the construction is not so good, especially the tray is difficult to slide into place. But I guess its ok for the price.    -- The fold-able option is great for travel. It does fold into a small pack and would not take much space in the trunk of a car.I also like the pocket for the tray at the back.

We needed a second seat for my husbands car for our 3 yr old and decided (after finding this on sale for a VERY good price else wear) that this was worth a shot. The install is \\""ok\\"" I mean I am used to installing our britax seats and they are so user friendly I forgot how difficult it can be to install other seats... Ultimately I did get a pretty good install after quite a while, sweating and fighting back a few curse words;) I do like that the seat has cupholders, and so does my little sweetie (she says \\""ooooo one for a drink and one for a snack\\"")  What I don't like... lack of padding, again maybe I'm just spoiled but the only padding to this seat is the seat cover. I cannot imagine this being comfy for long hauls. Good thing that this is only for daddy's car and my kids are only in there a few times a year tops. Also the color (we got the light one) and material type make this a dirt MAGNET. Like I said the install is rougher than I'd like it to be BUT we did get a good install so it IS possible. I would not want to move it back and forth though that's for sure. The harness has to be rethreaded to adjust the height, I love my boulevards, no rethread is worth the money to me.  What I do like... The higher rear facing and 5 pt front facing limits. It's nice to know that if ppl are in the market for a seat on a limited budget they can still transport their kids safely rather than cutting corners to save money. It's not super heavy, so if we did have to move it, or travel with it it's not gonna kill you. Although it is wide so I don't think i would attempt to use it to fly.  Ultimately I'd say if you need a second seat, or you find a great deal on this seat go for it. Otherwise I'd go for a britax marathon or boulevard. Frankly they are totally worth it if you are going to be using them everyday:)",2/9/2012

I didn't give up though, and dragged it back out yet again once he was older and could sit forward facing, and installed it in a Ford Focus as a backup car seat.

We've only been using it for a month, but I barely change ANY poopy diapers! As a parent, It's more about reading their signals, knowing their schedule, and getting them there in time. My daughter did make the connection though about a week or so in. Hopefully this isn't TMI, but she pushes every time I sit her on the seat... so I know she understands.<br /><br />So, why this seat and not one of the tons of others available? One word. COMFORT! We were at a friend's house and my daughter needed to go, but I hadn't brought the seat. My friend's daughter has a potty seat, so we tried it and she wouldn't go. I had to hold her, supporting her the whole time. The Bumbo potty seat is not as much support as the actual Bumbo because it doesn't come up as high, but my 5 month old could sit unsupported in it. (I don't leave my daughter unattended though.)<br /><br />The seat is made of the same quality material that a regular Bumbo seat is. It is super easy to wipe down. I've taken it out of the house with me and it fits on several types of toilet seats. Sizewise, its wider in the base than an actual Bumbo, but it's not as tall.<br /><br />I would make this purchase over and over again. I can't tell the future, but this should make actual potty training a breeze when she is ready! TOTALLY worth it!",10/18/2013

My daughter is now 5 and my 1-year-old son uses this booster and I'm amazed the great shape this seat has stayed in after all of the use it's had! This booster seat is not only easy to attach to a chair, it is also very secure, NOT sliding all over the place. It's very easy to clean, without any little spots for food to get trapped (and my kids were/are both very messy eaters!). It folds up nice and compact and is so easy to transport. I don't really use the tray often. The tray was actually the only thing I was disappointed with regarding this seat (though I still wouldn't be using it much even if I thought it was perfect b/c I like having my little guy right at the table with the rest of us.) The removable part of the tray that pops off for easier cleaning is very easy to pop off and my son figured it out right away and then would never leave it on. If you don't attach the removable tray, you also can't attach the cover. (But cleaning-wise the tray is still good - I just wash the whole blue tray right in the sink, no problem!) Also, my son still can use the tray if need be (he's 18 months and average sized) but my daughter (who was larger) had all ready gotten too big to use it at all by his age - While it has 3 different spots that you can pop the tray onto depending on the size of your child, my kids both had it at the biggest it could go from the first time it was used. The tray is also rather small - my son's small plates are too big to fit on it. The size is, to me, is perfect for travel and occasional use, but not for everyday (unless you don't use a plate and put all the food directly on the tray.) I would highly recommend this booster seat. It's one purchase I am very, very happy with!",3/29/2008

I was excited to give these to her to see what she thought since I purchased this product at a discount for an honest review. Her first thought was they were incredibly cute. These stickers not only have the number on them. They also have some decoration to them each one had a little monkey on them as well. There is just enough decoration to make them cute, but not too much that it distracts from your baby in the photo. I was a little worried that these stickers would leave a residue on their clothing since my girls are always sticking stickers on clothing and they always leave something behind on the clothing. My friend stated the stickers were not only easy to apply, they were just as easy to remover with no mess! She said there was no residue left on his clothes. When you are done with the stickers you can remove them from clothing and dispose of them; however, my friend the great idea of adding them to her scrapbook to indicate age instead of writing or printing something else out to glue on the page.

I definitely would not expect a long legged person to be able to fit in the front passenger.  But as long as I can fit in the car to drive, that's important.  This seat was very very easy to install.  We used the center lap/shoulder belt and boom, done.  Our LO seems to be quite content in the seat.

My two youngest are in radian car seats, which are very narrow. My oldest (5) recently graduated to a booster since she outgrew her 5 point harness by height. Now, if you've ever tried squeezing 3 car seats in the back of a smaller car, you know it takes blood, sweat, and swear words. And if one of those 3 seats happens to be a booster, it takes blood, sweat, and swear words on *Every single car trip*! So I was on the hunt for the seat that would be easiest to buckle.This seat fits nicely next to the rear facing radian. I do not think this would fit next to a forward facing radian. It puzzles in nicely. Its snug, but we were able to figure out a good \\""buckling technique\\"" and now we've got it down! It takes no longer to buckle than it does a 5 point harness. The shape of the seat is key! It fits better than even backless. Notice how there's a few inches between the shoulder wings and the armrest where there's no side? Go look at other high back boosters. They don't have that. Its also narrower in the front than the back, and at the bottom than at the arm rests. This is what saves the skin on the back of my hand and actually makes it possible to buckle!<br /><br />There's some pretty sweet safety features as well. I like that her head/neck is well cradled, and there's an energy absorbing \\""crumple zone\\"" in the back of the arm rests where the seat belt hits. Neat! My daughter seems to like the legrest extension, though I don't think that improves safety. Its a nice comfort.<br /><br />I never thought I'd pay this much for a booster (its more than most infant seats and convertibles!) but its worth it.. less than a down payment on a van, and its a pain in the butt enough to have to buckle 3 kids, one at a time, for each and every short little trip. If paying an extra $100 (over other brands like britax or diono) makes the process easier, faster,and saves me some skin on the back of my hands, then its worth it.",10/20/2012

We paired it with a Britax car seat and car seat adapter and have a system that works incredibly well.<br /><br />As for the stroller itself, some of the best features include:<br /><br />1) The ride.  The tires on the stroller are larger than typical stroller wheels and tires, and they are incredibly smooth.  They handle bumps on a sidewalk or street well, and they take the unevenness of the ground through grass well too.  We are looking forward to testing them on the beach this summer, and we expect they will handle things just as easily.<br /><br />2) The handlebar.  The cushioned, and movable, handlebar makes pushing the stroller very easy.  It's almost comforting to hold onto it, and your hands are cushioned the entire time.  My wife pushes it 5 miles each morning while walking and has had zero complaints about holding onto the handlebar... which on other strollers I couldn't say.<br /><br />3) The fold-down.  The one-handed fold of this stroller is magnificent.  I can grab the handle in the seat, it folds immediately, and I can put it into the back of our minivan all in one motion and in less than 5 seconds.  It's amazingly easy.  It's not so light than everyone could have the same experience, but I would venture that most would.<br /><br />4) Attachments. The ability to swap out attachments is a huge feature of this stroller.  On some days we like having the car seat attachments in the stroller so that our baby can see us as we walk, and she has the cover that she'll need from both of the seat and the stroller itself.  Other days we like to have her face forward with a tray for her food and toys, and switching back and forth between attachments takes less than 10 seconds.  Flexibility with this, almost like a system, is priceless.<br /><br />5) Storage.  The storage capacity on the bottom is just enough for a diaper bag and purse.  This stroller is not intended to hold your baby, the car seat, and 5 shopping bags during a trip out.<br /><br />6) One-piece seat.  One thing that I didn't think about with past strollers was that in some there was a gap at some point between their head and feet that allowed for wind/air to make its way through the stroller itself.  From head to toe, your baby is protected from the elements with this stroller.<br /><br />All in all, I'd buy this thing in a heartbeat again.

It was easy to assemble but a bit labor intensive; it took my husband about two hours to put it together, and he's a handy DIYer. The bed is really nice-looking and has modern lines, which I really appreciate. Also it appears well made, with two layers of \\""wood\\"" under the mattress area for extra support. And it doesn't take up a lot of space in my son's small room, another big plus. My son took to it right away and was sleeping in the bed exclusively by day two, making his transition easy as pie. I think it helps that the bed is very low to the ground and therefore not scary to youngsters.    However, I have to take two stars away because the bed is a small platform bed, meaning that the edges stick out about two inches from the mattress on all sides. Every time my son flings himself into the bed (which happens A LOT with an active two-year-old), he bangs his ankles, shins, and knees really hard. He now has giant bruises and welts all over his legs. I was hoping that this would improve once he learned to navigate around the frame but after having observed him use the bed for three weeks with no improvement, I think this is just part of the hazard of having this type of bed. I know several adults who are having similar trouble with their own platform beds. This isn't a problem I'm willing to accept for my toddler, however. This bed will likely be exchanged for something a little less hazardous to small legs.",7/20/2011

First of all the tray has a plastic middle piece that when the tray is pushed in all the way has got to be the most uncomfortable thing ever. It is right in the crotch area, and if you move they tray further then food falls all over the child and seat. Second, after removing the infant insert which is a joke in itself because it is not attached to the chair in any way so it constantly falls down, the actual chair itself is uncomfortable. The incline of the back along with the shape and hardness of the bottom make my son extremely uncomfortable to the point he can not even eat a full meal in it. My son is not big by any means, so I can't even imagine how uncomfortable it would be for a bigger child. Third is the harness, at the top where the harness touches the shoulders, for some reason it is rather narrow going down and was constantly rubbing his neck raw. Overall, I would not buy this chair again, and I am currently looking for a better product.",6/27/2012

I picked this chair out when I was pregnant, mainly because it looks cool and has a million great reviews. I thought it would be something that lasts forever making the cost worth it. Now my daughter is 18 months old and this thing is a bit of a burden. I just now ordered an expensive tray to attach to the highchair because my kid pushes away from the table with her feet and then finds herself too far away to reach her food. She thinks it's funny and now does it every single time I feed her. Which is why I need an attached tray. In addition to the tray I've also purchased the baby seat separately and the cushion set separately. I think in all it's ended up being about $375. For a highchair. After seeing the cost of the tray I very nearly just went to Ikea and purchased the $20 highchair and tray that I've used before at a restaurant and found that it works great. I honestly have no idea why I thought this would be good. Don't do what I did and get all swept up in the cool baby stuff and think you need the expensive things. After a year you find yourself donating so much of it or letting it sit in a closet unused. It's ridiculous. Also, when I first put this thing together, which was NOT SIMPLE, I found that the metal bar that goes across the middle of the chair had only one end drilled out to fit the screw. The other end was not. So my husband had to make a special trip to a hardware store to have it fixed. Another issue is that the cushions shrink and fade when washed. Another issue is the 5 point harness (WHY? This is not a friggin' car seat!) is difficult to fasten and unfasten every single time, and it just gets food embedded in it and is difficult to clean. Oh, and anytime you want to wash the cushions you must move heaven and earth to get the straps off the plastic thing and then unthread them through the holes. And it's clear that the straps are not comfortable for my kid. Try sitting with your back against a seat with thick straps and plastic things jutting out. Nice design, Stokke. I think if babies could speak NOTHING would be designed the way it is for them. They would all be able to tell us \\""Hey! There's a hard plastic thing poking into my back and I hate it. Therefore, I'm not eating this creamed chicken stuff you are trying to shove in my mouth!\\"" I'm really going to be glad when this can just be converted to a regular chair and moved into her room with a desk.

The sound just completely went out, and luckily both times it happened during the day so I noticed immediately and did not happen at night.  Amazon was of course great the first time sending a replacement same day but now that this happened again I requested a refund and ordered the Samsung SEW3037 instead.  I think there is a flaw with either a large batch of these or this design in general because there are many other reviews now noting the same issue.  I used it heavily during naps, all night etc but isn't that the point??? Really dissapointed in Motorola bc of this.... I expect a $240 monitor to last at least a year.<br />As for the monitor when it worked-- Great clarity, great range, sound quality is good but did pick up lots of background noise, and one note is the buttons/controls are set up oddly.  The volume you have to toggle to the menu to access which any parent knows at 3am when you dont want to wake your partner up this is annoying..and the Pan/Tilt buttons are on the left side in a row.<br /><br />In case anyone wants a comparison, I just received my new Samsung video monitor the SEW3037 model.  Its great.  Buttons are much better set up and parent friendly...Volume on the side, PT buttons in a circle layout, has a nightlight, and shows the time which is also a nice feature.  The clarity is very good...Same clear color for daytime but the motorola has a slight edge in the nighttime viewing. Still though, its clear enough to see my sons features, lost pacifier etc.  The sound is much better...the motorola picked up my sons white noise machine very loudly, this one does not and I hear him crystal clear.  It also has a VOX option so you can have it idle to a sleep mode when it does not detect a certain level of sound.

It fit perfectly in our sink, making bathing our newborn super easy. However, the pillow cushion never laid flat and was pretty much useless. We quickly outgrew the netting piece since the plastic divider piece in the main tub would dig into his back so we moved to the sitting position. With that, we also moved the bath center to the bathtub to allow for additional water overflow. I liked that baby couldn't slump down and slip into the water thanks to the divider, but as he grew I found the divider to be once again, more detrimental than helpful. At 4-5 months we stopped using this all together, mainly because it was uncomfortable leaning over the tub and trying to keep him seated. Thanks to the divider he had the leverage he needed to lean forward, arch his back, or push off of it.. making bath time very painful (for us) as we tensed up to keep him seated and ensure his safely. He would also wrap his tiny hands underneath the lip of the bath center and not let go!

Far from the truth. As long as you don't yank on the zippers, they stay on track. We love this trailer. We use it about 4-5 times a week with our 1 year old. He enjoys going on the rides too. The best part about this trailer is the cargo area behind the seat. I enjoy that we can pack water, food, and baby supplies without having to carry it directly on our person. Installation is very quick and easy. I watched the video on the trailer before I purchased it and committed it to muscle memory by the time it arrived. It's going to be a good one to grow into. The only con I can see so far is with the ventilation. But we don't zip the plastic up all the way at the top and I fold down the top left or right corner about 1 inch just so air flow can happen without directly endangering my child to debris. Debris, by the way, will happen even when the mesh is zipped. We found this out the hard way when I discovered a lot of dirt on my child's blanket. Luckily it doesn't seem to go all the way up to the face, but lesson learned regardless. We are looking to get a secondary hitch installation and hopefully via velo comes out with a cargo trailer so we don't have to change out our set ups when we go camping. It works alright as a jogging stroller, but I definitely prefer it as a bike trailer.",3/20/2015

I tried to breast feed for 1.5 weeks before giving up and switching to pumping and feeding.  He picked this bottle as his favorite and I ordered a bunch more.  The nipple is great because he has to get the whole thing in his mouth to drink (like a real boob) and he can sorta kinda hold the round bottle himself (he is 6 weeks now and has been able to do this for 4 weeks).  I was exclusively bottle feeding until this week when I decided to give breast feeding another try.  He still takes the boob!  No nipple confusion or discrimination!  Now I breastfeed at night and bottle feed during the day/when my husband or mom want to feed him.  This bottle is great.<br /><br />Con: milk does get caught behind the collar.  I would recommend a design improvement.  I just pull the bottle out of his mouth, give it a little shake to get the remaining milk into the nipple and let him enjoy a couple sip encore feeding.

Our small house has limited floor space and hardwood floors and this mat provides just enough cushion to make it comfortable for playing on during tummy time. The black and white pattern is great to stimulate developing eyesight, and it also looks cool on the living room floor (something that can't be said for most baby gear). The detachable toys are cute, and the loops on the bars also make it possible to attach other toys if your child has a favorite.

I figured 85% of 99 reviewers gave it 5 or 4 stars, so this must be the potty to buy and since I'm a first-time potty trainer, I'll rely on the reviews. I received this potty today, and am returning it tomorrow.<br />  The PROS:  The blue soft seat is comfortable, though it is pretty large for a two year old child, at around 10 inches in diameter. The handles are easy to grip, both by adults and little toddler hands. This potty is pretty light weight, which would make carrying it around easy, but it makes it less stable as I will explain below.<br />  The CONS: The lid falls down REALLY easily. If you just slightly nudge the potty, the lid will fall down. The lid also has a lip that hangs off of it and goes around it which has further plastic tabs that extend from it. Furthermore, these tabs have pointy parts that extend off of them (you can actually see these in the image). First, all these extensions from the lid seem like they will be a pain to clean, especially since it is suppose to be a splash guard for boys. But worse, if the lid falls on little body parts, it can be painful.<br />  The major con, though, is that there is absolutely NO GRIP on the bottom surface of this potty. If you want to know what the stability of this potty is like before buying it, just turn a plastic pail or bucket upside down and try to sit on it. The bottom of this potty is just a ring of thin plastic, like the top of a bucket, not even a full flat surface of plastic. If you plan on using this potty on a mat or rug, it will be good enough and probably won't slide, just as if you were to put that plastic bucket on a mat or rug. And because this potty is no heavier than a typical plastic pail, when a kid goes to sit on it on a smooth floor, it will move and slide around, and will most likely cause a toddler who has not yet developed perfect balance, to fall.<br />  This is what happened when my two year-old tried to sit on his new potty today. He was so excited to get his potty out of the box, and right after we placed it on the floor, he tried to sit on it. The potty slid out from under him and he fell. I think our potty training has been set back already, sigh.",10/23/2012

I put one of these on my son when he was about 5 months old. I figured I had nothing to lose by just trying it. By his first birthday he had about 8 teeth, and I'm a 100% positive his lack of drooling, fussing, crying, diarrhea, and general grumpiness, while cutting those teeth, was due to the Amber necklace. I never had to put a bib on him, and the teething tablet bottle turned into a rattle for him, I even tested it by taking it off for a few days here and there. Big mistake, he turned into a drooling mess...back on went the necklace! This was completely different than when my daughter was teething(did not use a necklace with her). It was really amazing the difference it made. I left it on him all the time even in the bath. He never messed with it or tried to take it off because he was so young when he started wearing it. I would say definitely try using this. It's reassuring that it's natural and inexpensive.",4/4/2015

After looking at many strollers (bugaboo, stokke, peg perego, etc)  we chose the quinny.  We have also previously owned, Aprica, Macleren, Graco and Peg Perego strollers.  We love how it unfolds at a touch (safety band prevents accidental unfolding) and it is by far the smoothest stroller on all kinds of terrain, from your neighborhood sidewalk to traversing across a grassy park.  I personally love the way it looks and it doesn't have the strolling spectacle flavor of say the stokke.  I also was concerned about the ease of use and unfolding/folding because of earlier reviews on the the Quinny.  However, this must have been a problem that was worked on by the manufacturer, as we find the quinny extremely simple to use, and although folding does require a bit of strength, once you get used to it you know exactly where and how to push down so that it folds quite easily.  The only major flaw I found and to me it's literally a \\""massive\\"" flaw, is that it is so HUGE when it is folded.  It is so big it will undoubtedly take up most of your vehicle's trunk as it does ours.  We have the Audi Q7, and we cannot use half of the third row if we want to fit the stroller in back.  Our Peg Perego and Macleren both fit very nicely.  A secondary flaw is the short sun-shade, which the manufacturer somewhat compensates for by providing a zip-in windshield.  Our stroller came with a basket which I believe is new, as older reviews talked about the lack of a basket and constantly kicking a bag that attached to the rear.  The basket though not huge is adequate for us and we can easily fit a 12\\""x10\\""x5\\"" diaper bag in it with some extra bottles of water.  In conclusion, if you can handle the large size and weight, it is indeed an excellent and very stylish stroller that works well in all conditions.",11/30/2007

In Aug 2011, I bought the city mini based on reviews I read.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Well priced for a double stroller<br />- Fits in all doorways, have never had any trouble with this<br />- Both seats recline / adjust so baby can nap laying back while big brother sits up<br /><br />The Not So Good:<br />- Front wheels lock into swivel mode but after 8-9 months the lever doesn't work so we had to stick a paper clip in there to hold the lever in place. Contacted the manufacturer and they seem responsive so far but have not received replacement parts yet. HOLD ON TO YOUR RECEIPT FOR THIS AS YOU NEED PROOF OF PURCHASE FOR WARRANTY.<br />- Storage is not great as it's at bottom of stroller and hard to get to. No cup holder = has to be purchased separately.<br />- NOT EASY TO CLEAN as few parts are detachable. For anyone getting this for twins, and is a first time parent, strollers get filthy from older kids who have been playing at the park or spill drink / food all over the seats. You want a stroller you can clean. We have had to hose this one down and let it dry out in the sun on a hot day.<br /><br />I have to say as expensive as the Orbit was, its worth the money. I used it the other day when I took the baby out on her own and its still going strong. It's also very easy to fold up and put away. I have never tried putting the double baby jogger in a car.

All crevices and corners can be reached for cleaning<br />+ Great for travelling. We used this on the plane, hotel, airport with no problems. Fits inside my LeSportsac Diaper Bag. Has never been torn or broken.<br />+ because it's a rubber like texture, the seat doesn't move around. If it does, just give it a wipe down on the underside (usually if it's dusty the seat loses grip)<br />+ splashguard is high, perfect for toddler boys! if pee is all over the underside (as one reviewer noted), he just has to lean forward a little when he pees. if he pees directly straight onto the splashguard without any lean, it's most likely to cause a mess on underneath the seat.<br />+ I think it fits most toilet seats, as I have used it for all different toilet sizes while traveling, the key is to make sure he leans forward a little each time he pees<br /><br />Cons:<br />- none!<br /><br />****Note: My son is 43inches, 36 pounds and the potty is too small for him now.

It rear faces up to 40lbs and 40in, and forward faces up to 65lbs and 54in. My 3 1/2 year old son is just about to grow out of his convertible, an Evenflo Tribute V, and the Tribute forward faces for as long as the Sureride rear faces. Think about that for a second. With higher weight and height limits for both rear and forward facing, of course it's going to be bigger. It has to accommodate bigger children after all. I don't know why I wasn't expecting it to be monstrously huge, though. With those numbers, if you're going to get it for a newborn, infant, or young toddler, expect the seat to expire before they grow out of it while forward facing.<br /><br />I have yet to actually install it in my car, a '07 Jeep Liberty. I have memo---nightmares from almost 3 years ago from just trying to get the tribute to fit rear facing. It's definitely better suited for a mini van. I will update this review periodically.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />The car seat didn't actually take up as much room in my car as I was afraid it was going to. The front seat can't be back all the way like my husband likes it, but it does leave a comfortable amount of room. I'm not exactly a short woman, either. It is rather difficult to install, but no more than most convertible car seats in the rear facing position. I'm planning on getting it checked out by a tech just in case.

(This stroller can also be used with an adapter for the Quinny carseat, so yet a 3rd use.)  So far so good, I bring my baby with me anywhere I go in the house (or going out) using the bassinet, and when I need it I change it for the normal stroller seat.  You can see a picture of how the stroller looks with the bassinet in the images of the Quinny Senzz Flame color stroller.

Our twins started using these at around 9-10 months age consistently and before that for water. Our kids did really well with it. The suction is also not straining for the little mouths. Milk comes up easily.<br /><br />Initially, we did have some leaking issues but, we noticed that if the lid was not sitting right it would leak. I had to check it from the side to make sure the lid was on right. Also, one of our cups had been defective as it just did not stop leaking. I contacted Zoli Customer service and they were really, really nice on the phone. The person I talked with said the newer bottles have a thin silicone liner inside to prevent leaks. She sent me a replacement cup and some extra liners. I was VERY happy with the customer service response. This just makes me want to do business with them.

I deliberately waited a long time to write a review on this item because so many reviewers mentioned odor becoming more noticable after solids were introduced.  We have not had ANY odor problems with the champ.<br />I chose this diaper pail because it seemed easy to use &amp; it didn't need proprietary bags.  It is easy to use, although when you first start using it you'll need to get used to the way the release mechanism works on the lid when you change the garbage bag.  It's kind of tight &amp; if you're not careful you could break a nail.  (I have short nails so it's not an issue for me.)  However it is so simple to just plop a diaper into the pail &amp; flip the top.  That's it.  Then when the pail is full you just change out the garbage bag.  I keep a box of inexpensive garbage bags in the bedroom where the baby can't get to them, but they're easy to access when I need them.<br />As far as odor control goes, I exclusively breastfed my son for his first 9 months.  We did not have any problems at all while he was exclusively breastfed, nor are we having any now that we're slowly introducing solids.  Since he started eating solids his poop does smell much stronger, but the champ is a pro at keeping odor at bay.  I don't even use Lysol or other sprays.<br />We keep the champ in the master bedroom &amp; our cats litter box is in the master bathroom.

Since they didn't end up tending as often as they thought, they gave it to us.  Our baby, now 20 months old, has been using it since he was 6 mos.  We do a lot of driving, and it is actually pretty good, considering it is an economy model.  It is really easy to install into both of our cars, and the latch system is really nice when we use our newer vehicle.  For our older car, we had to find a restraint locking clip so that the seatbelt would hold it in firmly, but once we got one it has never had a problem with wobbling.  The only downside is that while our baby is very tall and large for his age, his legs are still short and stick straight out instead of being able to bend at the knee at the edge of the seat, which could be dangerous if we are ever in an accident.  The other problem we had was we couldn't get the cupholder to attach securely, so we didn't ever end up using it.

I have only jogged on straight paths so far, the wheel lock makes me a bit nervous to turn, so I can't comment on that. VERY easy to fold up, just a quick tug and it stands up by itself. I have to take the back wheels off to fit it in my Chevy Malibu, but I can still slide it all the way back and still have more than half my trunk left! Lol. I could even fit a pack n play and another stroller in there easily. And the back wheels come off and on so easy. It's a bit on the heavy side, so I wouldn't recommend carrying it if you can help it, (If the back wheels are left on, it rolls just fine.) The basket holds SO much more than my old stroller, it's great. I didn't have any problems fitting my smart phone in the tray lock, you would have to have a pretty big phone, but you could always just put it inside the tray too.<br /><br />EDIT 10/14/13 -- So I've had this stroller for about 6 months and I use it at least three times a week, and for some reason now, the wheel will lock straight randomly when I'm walking. It doesn't really bother me much, just surprises me when I go to turn. I have had NO problems with it when it's locked though, it doesn't unlock on me while we're jogging. Just the opposite. Other than that, this stroller is holding up great! It's almost like new. Cleans easily, still folds up great (I have found that the seat needs to be fully reclined, the canopy back, and the front wheel in swivel mode for it to fold up flawlessly every time.) My son is two now and still loves going to walks and runs in this. :]is two now and still loves going to walks and runs in this. :]",5/30/2013

BPA-Free Premium Glass Bottle with Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack",Baby,0,0,N,Y,"Great bottles, no air bubbles, do not leak","We used these for our first child and had to add a few for our second round (2 babies, need more bottles).  We used them for 15 months with our first and no leaks.  We plan to reuse all of the original bottles with some new nipples and filters.  The air bubbles are protected by the filter (you can see them flow back in and not into the nipple).  The parts are easy to clean (we used a dishwasher basket exclusively) and easy to reassemble (2 part filter, nipple, and ring).<br /><br />I can't say enough about how easy glass is to clean compared to plastic.  It also frees up your top dishwasher rack for other things because they are bottom rack safe.<br /><br />Some people complain about how heavy they are.  We never knew the difference because we always used them and never thought them to be too heavy.  The glass is sturdy because ours took a few drops on hardwood without a crack at all (not something I would recommend, but it happens).<br /><br />On the other hand, I would not let a toddler walk around with a glass bottle.  But should a kid who can walk around really be using a bottle?!",5/31/2013

The Infantino Tie Wrap is quite comfortable and it allows the baby to face forward or towards you and can be worn on your back, but it doesn't have the head support like the Ergo Baby and also takes a little more effort to put on and to put baby into it. My other carriers are the [[ASIN:B004VB0GRG Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Slate]], the [[ASIN:B0010PW3A4 Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining]] and the [[ASIN:B0009JOSNM BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton]]. The Moby is very comfortable and excellent for the first 2 months of birth since baby can snuggle right in there with you and you can get skin to skin contact. BUT the Moby wrap has so much fabric and takes a while to put on and take off. The Baby Bjorn is the easiest to get baby in and out, but it is the least comfortable on my shoulders. I can barely last 30 minutes with a 15 pounder. The Ergo carrier provides the most comfortable hold for the parent which enables me to carry around my little one longer than the other carriers. It's easy to put on and take off and equally easy for my little one to get in and out. I love that there's a head cover for shade and sleeping babies. You can use this carrier on your back too. the Ergo is also a favorite for dad.<br /><br />If you want a more comprehensive review on baby carriers, visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com.

This is the only way we have found to secure the car seats into the car.  My wife was in an accident and our SUV tipped onto its side.  I didnt have the mighty tite on the car seats at the time but the seats were installed correctly.  My daughters car seat was still loose enough that it slipped sideways and she hit her head on the window.  If you think you car seat is tight enough then install it correctly then grab onto it and jerk it back and forth with all your might.  A 35 mile per hour collision would move the car seat a lot farther than you can push or pull on it.  If your car seat moves maybe you should think what it would be like for your child sitting in that seat during a roll over or impact.  Just beacuse a car seat sits nicely in the car doesnt mean it will remain secure during an accident.  So give your car seat the tug test and see what happens.  Then get a mighty tite, jerk the seat belt to lock it then crank it down with the mighty tite.  (Dont forget to put something under your car seat as it will be so tight it could leave marks on your seats - I use a rubber car seat matt from kids-r-us) After you put the mighty tite on try the tug test again, you cant move the seat.

That said, there are two design flaws that I'd love to see fixed: One, when a boy pees standing up into this potty and hits the splash guard in the back, the urine runs into the cracks between the blue and white pieces and onto the floor. Why not make it so that the potty seat somehow slips *under* the blue spash guard so that the inevitable misfires are directed to the right place?

Now I can take a shower, catch up on bills, eat a meal or just relax for 30 minutes or longer.  One thing I do recommend though is to make sure to move the mobile to the side of the crib if you are trying to put your baby to sleep. My son is so stimulated by it he refuses to close his eyes when it's in his field of vision.  If getting a few minutes to yourself matters to you, you will buy this mobile.",10/11/2003

She is 3 months old now. The original Graco was battery powered, and after spending $10 per week for batteries every week for 3 months, we decided we could have bought this swing, plugged it in, and it would have nearly paid for itself by now. Bottom line, if you have any sense about you, get a plug in swing (AC adapter is how it will be listed) unless you want the joy of having your baby run out of juice at 2am when the swing is your go-to place for getting her/him to sleep.<br /><br />On to this swing... my admiration to anyone who says they &#34;put this swing together in 30 minutes.&#34; This was not our experience. It arrived with 4 screws to fasten, so it sure looked like it would be easy out of the box... famous last words. Thing is, all the elastic bands and screws and other assorted clicking fastener stuff requires you to have fingers the size of a 3-month-old to reach because of the little nooks and crannies these things are hidden in. So it took us about 2 hours to get this done. My suggestion is unless you have a team of elves handy, plan for an entire evening to get this swing together. This designed-by-Beelzebub assembly required is the reason we give this product 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />That said, once it is assembled, this swing is much nicer than our other Graco (sorry, don't know the specific name for that one, but it rocks back and forth as opposed to side-to-side like this one). The diameter of the tubing is much thicker on this one and it is very sturdy. Sturdy enough that it looks like I could climb into it were the seat big enough to fit. On the other hand, the other Graco we have looks like it was made out of the skinny metal tubing you have on those lawn chairs you bought from the drugstore... the ones that bent as soon as someone with some size to 'em sat in one.<br /><br />Here is a summary of our findings:<br /><br />Pros<br />- Our baby hadn't slept in almost 24 hours. No idea why. Hadn't happened before nor since. We put her in this swing and she was out in 10 minutes. Sleep is good!<br />- The ability to plug it in is a godsend. This should be required for all swings. Yay! No more slavery to Duracell.<br />- The design is very sturdy. Graco knows how to make it so it won't break. No anxiety!<br />- The seat is large and looks like it will fit our baby for several more months. No buying another one!<br />- While the classical music on the speaker sounds like it came straight out of a Grey Poupon commercial, the half dozen nature sounds are almost the same as the ones we use on our white noise machine in her crib (e.g., birds chirping, waterfall, ocean waves, heartbeat). Hooray for no obnoxious baby music! We like white noise that masks household noises.<br />- The mobile has bears on it and the fabric in the swing is a gender-neutral dark red and grey. Woohoo! not everything has to be pink or blue...<br />- The motor seems much smoother than our other Graco. While it is audible, it doesn't make nearly the metronome click of the other model. Seems strong enough but we haven't put enough mileage on the engine to really say anything about durability yet...<br />- It replaces our other vibration station. Our original vibration station sits on the floor. Replacing it with this one raises her off the floor, which is helpful since we have a 100-pound German Shepherd who might step on her or tip her over on in the floor model. We like safety!<br /><br />Cons<br />- The vibration function rattles the seat when it is on. One of those things where if you put your hand on it and push it in a little, the rattling stops... and then starts back up as soon as you let go of it. We plan to take this apart and put it back together and hopefully the rattling will cease...<br />- Be sure your children are not in the room when you put this together. Some of the words that came out of our mouths were not Rated-G...<br /><br />Overall, this swing would score a 5 out of 5 if we could have bought one already assembled and saved the aggravation of the-one-demon-screw-who-would-not-fit, which required divine intervention an hour to seat this one screw properly. So buy it and talk someone else into putting it together for you and life will be good!is swing would score a 5 out of 5 if we could have bought one already assembled and saved the aggravation of the-one-demon-screw-who-would-not-fit, which required divine intervention an hour to seat this one screw properly.

I have a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn and have already used it 5 times.  IT steers great (compared to the jeep wagoneer which I returned because it steered like a bus and gave me a backache)!  It is VERY EASY to manuever, especially when shopping at the mall.  I love the fact that the car seat fits in the back and front, because I put the seat in the front part of the stroller when my 2 1/2 year old wants to sleep reclined in the backseat.  The only thing I would change with this stroller is that it is hard to put anything in the storage compartment when the baby seat is in the back or the seat is reclined but that is the only problem with this stroller.  The car seat I received with this stroller is a 5 point harness and not a 3 point.  IT is very easy to adjust the straps from the front (unlike my evenflo).

The problem is that the latch that releases the stroller to pop open catches on the canopy and stops the opening process halfway through, or rips through part of the material in order to open. The tray that comes around the front of where the child sits also gets trapped under other parts of the stroller furthering the difficulty of opening it. It still closes just fine. However, it is when I am opening it that I would rather have had the ease last.<br /><br />*Update:<br />  Coming up on four years with this stroller now, it still works fine, the side panels are destroyed from the lock release snagging on them though.

It seems to fit diapers well also. I have a small problem with the bottom wipes drying out and turning yellow. However, after trying out different wipes (pampers wipes do not fit) I realized that Huggies Supreme wipes work the best. They don't dry out near as fast. Also, I still use the bottom wipes even if they are a little yellow. They don't hurt my sons skin. So I'm really not wasting any wipes and the wipes warm up quite well. Use the wipe the minute you take it out of the warmer though,otherwise the wipe will get cold quick. I think overall it's worth buying.",11/7/2002

Very comfortable.  As a 1st time parent (couselor and avid reseacher) I new the importance of day-time sleep but I just couldn't get her to stay asleep in her crib during the day (Thank God that was not the case at night...largely due to being swaddled in a Miracle Blanket...one of my other favorite baby products).  I would wear her after her morning feeding and changing and she would be asleep in 15 min tops freeing me up to eat breakfast, pay bills, do some light cleaning.  There is a lot of research indicating baby wearing is beneifical for both baby and parent.  I wanted her to have as much contact as possible before I had to go back to work at 8 weeks.  She is almost 10 months old now and I still wear her.  I can run the sweeper and do other things around the house. It is a great way for her to explore your world with out breaking your back and arm.<br /><br />P.S.  My husband even broke down and put it on a couple times despite the fact he said it was a little too feminine for him.  He prefers the bjorn. My little one is ok with bjorn now but she wasn't when she was little.  With the moby, you can tuck their little heads in and they don't go anywhere.  She flopped around too much in the bjorn at first.  (Bjorns are also waaaaaay more $$$$ than Moby).<br /><br />A couple other things: 1.) I learned to stuff a burp cloth btwn me and the baby for 2 reasons (1.) spit-up(duh). (2.) My little one would get very hot against my skin and would sweat...then we would both get hot. A barrior btwn the skin was helpful for this.<br /><br />Watch some YouTube videos for further instruction on wearing.  It is easy once you get the hand of it.",8/9/2010

The primary seat is a Head Wise™ 70 Convertible Car Seat featuring Safety Surround™ Side Impact Protection Lowell.<br /><br />When you get the seat connected using the LATCH system in a rear-facing position, they are very difficult to squeeze so you can remove the seat.<br /><br />I compare this to the Head Wise, which has a button style release for the connectors that hook into the LATCH system. The buttons make it easy to release the clips and remove the seat.<br /><br />The cup holder broke... this was totally unexpected, especially as it never really connected securely to the frame of the seat, so how it broke, I don't fully understand.<br /><br />The cup holder in the Head Wise is molded into the seat.

I'm not going to argue that both are great prices, but for almost $90...

1654,US,50844966,RJBYTKK44CVM8,B00A2W7NGK,387940154,UPPAbaby BabyGanossh Footmuff with Primaloft (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Baby,26,28,N,Y,"Not very warm, not very nice-looking, and not very practical for smaller babies.","I bought this for my Vista without even looking at other options, figuring that the good design Uppababy brings to its strollers would carry through to this accessory. Wrong. After having used this all winter on my now nine-month-old in a location where temperatures are in the high 20s to low 40s during the cold months (not Mission Viejo!), this is what I've found.<br /><br />First, although the footmuff is easy to install and fits tightly around the seatback of the stroller, the end of it flops around unsecured. This is irritating when you're trying to get baby in and it slides around, or when you're trying to fold the stroller while keeping the footmuff tucked inside. Plus it doesn't look very nice, which is a shame for a good-looking stroller. A few simple toggles would have allowed it to be easily fastened to the metal frame on the stroller's legrest.<br /><br />In addition, there is no way to adjust the length of the footmuff. For smaller babies, it should be able to be folded up so that tiny legs are not lost in a large cold pocket of air. My baby's legs are way up in the top part while the rest of it just hangs uselessly. Not very cozy. Again, a few simple toggles could have accomplished this.<br /><br />This footmuff also doesn't accommodate smaller babies in that there is only one set of snaps for attaching the top. Contrary to how it appears in the photo, the top does NOT roll down like that. So I have two choices: leave the top cover unsnapped so my baby's chest and upper body are exposed, or snap the top cover, which puts it over baby's face. I compromise in only snapping one side, bringing the level on this side to higher than baby's head, leaving the other side below baby's chest, and draping it so that it doesn't cover baby's face. This kind of messing around is not ideal, obviously. There really should be snaps at a few different levels to allow adjustment for babies of all different heights.<br /><br />In summary, the size of the footmuff is probably great for older kids at the higher age range of the stroller, but not for younger, smaller babies.<br /><br />Importantly, I'm not so sure the footmuff is so warm. After a two-hour walk with temperatures in the 40s, for example, I noticed during a diaper change that my baby's leg skin was cold to the touch. Some of this could be due to the inability to adjust the size of the footmuff to keep it cozy for smaller babies. Whatever the reason, I stopped trusting the footmuff alone and began also either putting my baby into a snowsuit or bringing a blanket, or both, which kind of defeats the convenience factor of having a footmuff.<br /><br />After having read other reviews, I agree that it's nice that the zipper runs across the footmuff for ease of opening/closing, but I have other issues with it. The zipper always seems to get snagged on the material around it, especially when I open it, so I always need two hands - one to zip/unzip with, the other to pull the zipper lining fabric out of the way and to undo snags. It's annoying. It should be able to open and close smoothly.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out, some kind of inside protection from dirty shoes would be a good idea. The fabric is very thin and lightweight and seems like it could be easily damaged or dirtied. We'll see next winter when baby's walking.<br /><br />Last little points. This thing can get static as heck. And why is there such a limited color range in colors that seem to clash with, instead of coordinate with, the Vista colors? I went with basic black, but even the black doesn't match nicely with the black of my Vista. Small detail, but when you're paying the price for both stroller and footmuff, you want it to look good.<br /><br />Would I buy this again? No. Would I recommend that you buy it? No. Do I regret having bought it? Yes. Next time I need an accessory for my Vista, I'll be sure to check out all of my options instead of just assuming that Uppababy will do it best.y great for older kids at the higher age range of the stroller, but not for younger, smaller babies.<br /><br />Importantly, I'm not so sure the footmuff is so warm.

While searching for a potty chair for my son, my main concern was the \\""deflector\\"".  Some chairs had deflectors that are hard plastic, & I was concerned that he might hurt his \\""little manhood\\"" when sitting if he sat on the deflector.  Other seats had deflectors that were hinged to flip down for girls, & I figured he'd be tempted to play with it while he was doing his business, or that it would flip down on it's own as he was trying to sit.  When I found the Safety 1st Comfy Cushy 3-in-1 Potty, I thought I had found the perfect solution.  Since it's soft it wouldn't hurt him if he accidently sat on the deflector, but after only 2 months of use I'm searching for another potty.  Why?  The soft blue ring is getting saturated with urine...yuck!  I figured that urine might get under the ring & expected it to be a little bit of a nuisance while cleaning, but I never considered that the urine would soak into the ring.  I just assumed that the ring was waterproof, but it's not.  The underneath side of the deflector & around the front of the ring is turning an ugly brown & there is even one spot that looks like mildew!  As other reviewers have stated, it won't clean out.  I've tried soap/water & Clorox wipes.  When I dump the potty, I have to take tissue & \\""squeeze\\"" the ring to get most of the urine out, but it won't come completely clean.  Ugh...I wish I'd known this before I bought this potty. My \\""1 star\\"" rating probably only applies for use with boys.  I really think it would be a good potty for girls.  I like that the top ring is removable & can be used on a grown up toilet & that it can also be used as a step stool.  Unfortunately, I think it will become a permanent \\""step stool\\"" in our house, if I can find a suitable \\""potty\\"" replacement.  The search continues.",3/9/2009

I started using this when my son was about 4 months old(would have loved it even earlier).

That said, I assumed this would take the place of a dishwasher, getting the bottles clean in 6 minutes, as claimed on the box.  But the instructions recommend a full washing by hand or in a dishwasher first.  Of course you need to rinse everything well first, but a full washing...  The 6 minute claim is sort of misleading, too.  In fact, it takes six minutes after the initial 4 minute warm up period for a total of 10 minutes per cycle, with a 10 minute rest period needed between cycles.  Back to the dishwasher thing.  The one basket is dishwasher safe, and can be then stuck directly into the sanitizer, but the other parts of the sanitizer are not dishwasher safe.  Not that you should have to wash them except for aestetic purposes.  When you want to dry it, you can put all the pieces upside down to drain, but there are plenty of water traps on the underside of each item to make the drying process less than efficient.  Thankfully, there is a cord wrap underneath the item with three exit channels for versatility.  Unfortunately, because the cable is thick (thick coating, but only 16 AWG) it is near impossible to get the cord wrapped up completely.  That part of the design could have been better.  For all this minor nitpicking, the AVENT does what it is supposed to do well.  Mostly, the design is very good, with the three size configurations, the bottle cap holder, the exhaust vent and the physical on/off switch that actually turns itself off  [positive stop] after a cycle.  It looks like the only difference between this product and other models in the line (besides size) is the \\""ready\\"" indicator light that comes on after the product has cycled through.  I thought about other uses for this product.  Canning?  Could probably work well for sterilization of small jars and lids.  Home brewing?

(tl;dr: it's great so far).<br /><br />I received a broken unit as an open box model from Warehouse Deals.  I would normally just blame any damage on shipping or the &#34;open box&#34; nature of the order, but I was concerned because other reviewers had mentioned the exact same point of failure:  the latch that closes the primary cover, where dirty diapers are placed.<br /><br />So I chalked it up to an actual product defect and prepared to return the item to Amazon.  However, before I did that, Bubula contacted me and promised to make it right.  They claimed that some of the units did indeed leave the factory with an overlooked defect, and they offered to send me a replacement part to get my Bubula working.  I think that's just solid customer service, and not every company would do that, especially for someone who bought a used item.<br /><br />The new lid was shipped quickly (arriving incidentally while I was at the hospital with my wife, who was delivering our daughter), and it was easy to swap out the part with a screwdriver.  The piece that broke in the first model has indeed been completely redesigned, and it looks much more robust and durable.<br /><br />Through a little more than a week of hard use (with a newborn going through 10-12 diapers a day), the Bubula has performed very well.  Newborn, breastfed babies don't really make stinky diapers, so I can't speak to its ultimate odor reduction capabilities, but the room is indeed stink-free so far.  Ask me again when she starts solid foods next year.<br /><br />I like the look of the thing, the fact that the can is stainless steel, the fact that it comes in many colors, and that it requires only regular kitchen trash bags.  I believe the defect that affected a small number of products has been fixed, and I respect the company for acknowledging the problem and offering to help me out.  They've really been great about the whole thing.<br /><br />While I only have a short time with the Bubula so far, I expect that it will perform well as one of the best diaper pails available today.<br /><br />Update:  Four months in, and I think the Bubula really is the best option out there for diaper disposal.  Friends and family are frequently lamenting their more popular diaper pail's reliance on proprietary bag refills and such, as well as things like broken plastic gears that render a cheaper unit useless.  I've used the Bubula every day for four months, and it's as good as the day the first soggy diaper crossed its stainless threshold.  No messes, no stains, no odors (other than the scented/neutralizing kitchen bags we use).  I'm a fan, but I still have yet to test it with truly stinky solid food diapers.  The thing seals well, so I believe it will be as good or better than any other available solution out there.hort time with the Bubula so far, I expect that it will perform well as one of the best diaper pails available today.<br /><br />Update:  Four months in, and I think the Bubula really is the best option out there for diaper disposal.

I have made it work a few times after a significant struggle. I have ended up sweaty and frustrated even after watching videos and reading instructions.

It was a little difficult to install it in the center seat of my car BUT this is actually the case with EVERY car seat I have installed in this car. The Latch straps are just barely long enough to reach the latch points so you need to push down on the seat when attaching the straps. This is really not a problem as the net result is the seat does not move at all.<br /><br />I really like the way the shoulder strap height adjusts with every other car seat i have seen you have fixed points that you must re-thread in order to adjust. With this seat you lay the shoulder strap flat is it slides up and down, it locks in when it is no longer flat. This is exceptionally useful and makes adjusting the seat for the baby really easy.<br /><br />Overall, the seat is great and I have no complaints.",6/13/2012

We bought this gate hoping it would fit either the top of our stairs which is very wide or the top of my mother's stairs which needed to be mounted at an angle.  Well, it worked for both. I ended up ordering two. This gate is very 'smart' and sturdy.  For wide spaces its perfect because of how it slides to the exact size you need. Most gates that I have purchased needed extentions which made them flimsy.  It's one solid gate with a small 'foot' at the bottom for extra support.  In addiotion, most gates need special spacers if you have molding, making mounting difficult and the need for additional parts. This gate comes with spacers that you can use to mount it, they just snap into place.  Installation took me about 10 minutes per gate and all I used was a screwdriver. Depending on where you install it, you may want to use anchors. The gate can slide to the smallest position and lay flat against the wall when not in use. It can easily be taken off the hindges and put away if you wanted it out of sight for any reason.  You can mount it at an angle just as easily as well. Lastly, it's tall so my little one can't reach the top but simple enough that my 5 year old isn't trapped behind it either. This gate is just about perfect.",8/16/2012

What an upgrade!,"Our infant is about to outgrow his Chicco KeyFit30 seat and I read and researched about all the available convertible-type seats and ended up selecting the Britax Advocate 70 CS. The reason why we decided to go with this car seat is that it simply had ALL the features we were looking for - Safety being the top priority, comfort, ease of installation and not to mention stylish!     The safety features are simply the best (I won't bore you with all the details since you can read it on the Britax website) - every part of the car seat is well thought out and designed! The car seat is solid (steel frame- nothing feels or looks flimsy!) and well made. When I took it out of the box to prep for installation, I read through the instructions, familiarized myself with all the parts, visited the website to look at the how-to videos. Once equipped with the information, it was a cinch to install. It took me less than 15 mins to get the carseat installed and secured. We bought the Cowmooflage design which is whimsical and the fabric is soft and comfortable to the touch. The features like the belly pad, the additional cushions/chest pads, chest clip, etc. to help ensure a snug and comfortable fit for my child were clever and practical. We love the velcro on either side of the seat that holds the straps in place so that you can put your child in the seat easily.  The height adjusting mechanism is a brilliant idea and a great time saver. Also, you can easily remove the seat cover for washing, without having to uninstall the seat itself! Another excellent time saving idea! In my opinion, the attention to these types of details is what makes Britax stands out.    Since this is only month 1 owning this, we'll have to reserve comment on its durability and ease of care until a later date. I was skeptical that it will not live up to all the hype, but so far, the item has not only met but has exceeded our expectations... We would buy this again in a heartbeat!",10/9/2010

Having graduated from the Orbit Baby Cargo Pod, I was about to give this Cargo Basket a 1 star rating until I read the simple manual on how to properly install it. The issue is that I was already used to using their original Cargo Pod which simply slides into place that I thought it was the same thing for this Cargo Basket.<br /><br />When I slid this basket into the frame rails, the whole bottom was sagging underneath that if you place just about anything on the basket, the cloth will drag onto the floor. I was scratching my head Orbit could not have badly designed it with this kind of flaw. And then I picked up the seemingly simple manual.<br /><br />By the front of the basket there are two innocent looking clips. You tug and pull the metal frame on both sides until it reaches the front part of the actual stroller frame. You will notice that the stroller frame has hidden holes covered by plastic that retract. You snap the innocent looking plastic clips into the holes of the stroller frame and there you have it - a very spacious and secure Cargo Basket that mimics the cargo basket of other strollers.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this Cargo Basket instead of the Cargo Pod if you already have a baby bag and if you feel that you need to carry more than what the Cargo Pod can hold. The Cargo Pod is very neat. But by having that initially, I ended up purchasing the Bassinet which made the stroller very wide - visually.<br /><br />Now on my second Orbit Baby stroller, I opted for this Cargo Pod so I can skip the Bassinet and instead have a proper baby bag to hang at the rear of the stroller.<br /><br />As usual with Orbit Baby, the material of this Cargo Basket is top notch. It is Oeko-Tex certified which simply means it is \\""healthy and clean\\"".<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />1. Holds up to 5 lbs (2kg)  with a capacity of 6.5 gallons (25 liters).<br /><br />2. This is not obvious at all, but it sas reflective side panels on the left and ride for safe strolling at night.<br /><br />3. Has two zippered pockets for additional storage. It cannot house bottles in these side pockets, but flat objects like paperwork, tickets, wallets, money, etc.<br /><br />If you have an Orbit Baby G3 stroller, I would highly recommend this Cargo Basket. But please ensure to install it properly so the cloth will not snag underneath.<br /><br />ONE MORE THING:<br /><br />There is a hitch on this basket if you are using the Side Kick attachment (skateboard) like myself. The Cargo Basket alone can fold with the stroller no problem. The Side Kick attachment alone can fold with the stroller no problem as well. But if you have both attachments together, they will both snag against each other with the metal wires of the Carbo Basket rubbing against the wood of the skateboard. The solution is to meticulously fold one against each other slowly versus being able to twist and slam the stroller frame shut. When you unfold the stroller, you will have to carefully do the same. Otherwise you will end up with a not so pretty looking banged up wooden skateboard down the road.<br /><br />This is the reason why I have reduced the rating to 4 out of 5. The Side Kick is officially supported for the G3 so I am a bit disappointed with the two accessories not being good together.the left and ride for safe strolling at night.<br /><br />3.

At these concerts, people set up blankets and chairs on a grassy knoll, and I knew I wanted something durable, water-resistant, and light-weight to carry in and out of the concerts each week.  The JJ Cole All-Purpose Blanket was the perfect choice for this!<br /><br />1) DURABILITY-- This blanket has easily handled five years of weekly use, with toddlers, preschoolers, and now school-agers wrestling on it, &#34;surfing&#34; on it while dancing to music, using it as a sled down hills, and spilling tons of food and drinks on it.  It has also easily held up with the near constant folding and unfolding, throwing it in the back of the car, and even (yes!) running over it with my car.  It still looks practically brand new after five years of true abuse.  The ONLY sign of &#34;use&#34; it shows is the dead grass stuck in the velcro on the enclosure.<br /><br />2) WATER RESISTANCE-- Made of a nylon fabric with several layers, this blanket has worked BEAUTIFULLY on slightly damp grass, keeping me 100% dry.  It is also water-resistant on the top od the blanket and has easily handled MANY spills and even a leaking diaper.  It has always cleaned easily and has allowed most liquids to bead up and be easily to handle.<br /><br />3) WEIGHT-- It was important to me to have a lightweight blanket so I wouldn't be weighed down too much by carrying coolers, chairs, and blankets.  This blanket is perfect.  It weighs very little, and because of its folding ability and handle that can be slung over one's shoulder, it is barely noticeable when being carried.<br /><br />Folding this blanket is EASY.  It has a cardboard insert in one part that helps guide the user about how far in to fold the blanket.  It then rolls up and a velcroed flap holds it closed.  EASY!<br /><br />I would recommend this blanket to anyone who picnics, attends outdoor events that require sitting on the ground (kids' sporting events, perhaps?), play outside, or engage in any other such activities.  I suppose this blanket could also be used indoors, especially as a play spot for babies, but I've never used it indoors, so I cannot comment on that use.",1/7/2014

My daughter loves the cradle-feel of this swing. Unlike most swings where she would hunch down, this one supports her and she seems to enjoy it. <br /> <br />She's only a month old, and I know most people think their kid will outgrow it, but she's a large baby and swims in this still. I don't see her outgrowing it for a long time.  <br /> <br />Sometimes she likes the side to side, and other times she enjoys the front to back, so this is nice for variety.

It's easy to put together and take ...,"I got the mobile tonight.  I love it!  It's easy to put together and take apart.  I love the idea of the soother being able to be separate  from the arm.  The mobile only lasts about 5 months, so the separation of the soother from it allows it to be used a lot longer.  The mobile/animal hanger part can be removed and put on a stroller, ensure longer use if the child still likes it and/or, can be transferred back and forth between the mobile and stroller.  There are 3 options of sounds:  White noise, music, and county sounds, such as crickets.  There are 2 levels of volume for these.  There's a remote that comes with it. The remote changes the song and turns the mobile back on.  The downfall is that it doesn't turn it off.  The machine will automatically turn off after a few hours, it says.  Also, I'm not sure of the point of being able to change the lullaby, unless the infant gets calm to one particular song.  As far as hooking it to the crib, I feel it's top heavy and leans forward too much. It's held on by a rubber strap.  I tried tightening it as much as I could, but it's still unstable.  It leans forward and if you accidentally bump it, it moves a great deal.  I'm tempted to just put the soother on the bookshelf and not use it as a mobile.  I will have Jason try tightening it and see what he thinks tomorrow.  Overall, if we can get it tightened and more sturdy, I'd give it 5 stars.  If not, 4.  It's a great idea, they just need to come up with a better system to latch it onto the crib.",8/29/2015

The monitor does go &#34;to sleep&#34; after a certain time if there is no activity / movement. I wish it stated it somewhere in the directions. I thought my monitor was broken because it kept turning off! haha... Glad it's saving some battery though. :),6/10/2015

Due to a trip alone with my 2 year old pushed me to make a decision and I've been very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Lightweight, super easy to open and close (essential for transiting airport security without hassle)<br />-The treaded tires are great for less than smooth surfaces<br />-5 point harness: my child is secure, but it's still very quick to strap her in<br />-The carry/parent pouch: didn't think this was of importance until I got it, but now I love it and use it all the time.  It's actually pretty large, can hold keys, medium wallet, bag of snacks and a juice box no problem.  The water bottle slot holds about a 16.9 oz or a soda can.<br />-Handle height: I'm 5'9&#34; and have a very long stride.  I have bumped my feet a couple of times, but other than that it's very comfortable.<br />-Recline.  I knew from other reviews that this didn't recline very far, but it's plenty far enough that if my child is tired, she can lay her head down without it flopping forward or anything.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Depth of seat.  My daughter is a little tall for her age and while she can sit comfortably now, I think she won't sit very far back easily too much longer.  Well before she reaches the weight limit.<br />-Foot rest.  It's not bad, and this is really just because it's an umbrella stroller, but because the foot rest is flexible and narrow, my child gets uncomfortable keeping her feet there for a long time (her knees are up a little high).<br />Basically, taller kids may have less use or dislike using it for long periods of time.<br />-Length.  As I said, first use of this was on a trip and it didn't fit in the trunk of the rental (Ford Focus hatchback).  My home vehicle is much larger so it was no problem there, but just be aware if you drive a smaller vehicle, it may not fit in the trunk.<br /><br />Overall, this stroller has exceededmy expectations, especially because I couldn't spend more than $75 for one.

We were able to transition her to the Thinkbaby straw sippy cup during the day for milk at 12 months but for the past 2 months we could not get her to take anything but her bottle in the morning and before bedtime. I was hesitant to try a soft spout sippy b/c of what I read about them being bad for teeth, but I was desperate!<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars b/c it is not the perfect sippy out of the package. I would suggest these modifications:<br /><br />1) Remove the handles -- looks and feels more like a bottle this way. Plus from what I've read the handles make the bottle leak. I never used the handles once and have not experience ANY leakage.<br /><br />2) Upon the first try, the spout collapsed after a few sips which made my daughter very frustrated. Other moms have recommended using the Nuk Trendline spout. We gave it a try since I had one at hand (which my daughter refused initially), and of course she hated it even though on the Thinkbaby sippy. The Nuk soft spout has a small cross-cut opening on the opposite side of the nipple spout that vents air bubbles while the Thinkbaby soft spout does not. In a moment of sheer brilliance I made a tiny cross cut with a small exacto knife on the Thinkbaby soft spout in approximately the same position as the Nuk spout, tested it on myself and my daughter, and it worked!! With the cross cut, the spout does not collapse at all and my daughter drank almost her milk in one sitting!<br /><br />If you are desperate to transition from the bottle, I highly recommend this one, with the 2 modifications.

I haven't had to replace the batteries yet....and we use it a lot!  <br />Every time I place my son in his carseat, he looks at himself in the mirror and giggles. I had no problem getting it into my SUV. The carseat is in the middle seat, and I also have no problems seeing over it. I have tinted windows, and we can see the \\""light show\\"" day or night. Also....I live in South Florida, and My car sits outside all day long......the summer heat has had no affect on this product.",9/23/2005

I bought it because I read a good review on it. It does not leak which I really like however the straw does not reach the bottom of the cup to the cup has to be full in order to get anything out of it. Also there are so many parts to clean. And the water does not come out of the straw very easily. It would be good for a small baby just learning to use a straw but for my 18 month old girls I think they don't get as much water out as they want. And The lid is sometimes hard to screw on because the handles get in the way and the round cup is just so stout it can be difficult to do especially in a hurry. Anyway I bought this cup because I needed something that was leakproof and this basically is but I would not buy it again unless my babies were six months old and we could get more use out of it.,3/27/2014

I did a ton of research and then selected.  If you're looking for a less expensive option, I don't recommend these.  I LOVE my flip covers,  they're only a few bucks more and there's a world of difference.  I love my BG pockets, I'm so - so with the AIO (I have lint issues with those), and I even really like my elemental (would love if it was completely lined, I have 1 of the old style ones otw currently).  When I got this diaper in the mail I was disappointed.  It's very rough compared to all the others.  I initially thought the inserts would be similar to the flip organic overnight ones (my absolute fave liner ever!) but they're not.  Less expensive options that are better in my opinion are Alva Baby and Kawaii, there's even a new brand developed by a local store called Easy Care Diapers that I really like (it's a mix between the Alva and Kawaii in design and available online through Bumbledoo.com).<br /><br />While I absolutely hated this diaper and maybe used it once, I have a close friend that swears by them!  Luckily I'll be able to pass mine to her so it doesn't go to waste.  My advice is to try to check out a local CD store if available and actually feel the materials before buying, I wish I would have.<br /><br />As for pricing, the $11.95 with Prime shipping is the best price I've seen, other sites have it listed at $14.99 or similar.  Also, it is cheaper to buy 3 trial packs than the 3 diaper kit (listed just under $49 at the time of review, meaning you could get 4 single diapers for $1 cheaper!).",3/9/2014

One of his favorite things to do is lay on the mat and play. It has helped him with tummy time and he also rolls over both ways to do different things on the mat. He loves the mirror and he will pull on it, hang from it, and just sit up and look at it like &#34;who is this baby in here?!&#34; It's hilarious and fun to watch. He enjoys grabbing the hanging items with both his hands and his feet. He likes to get the monkey down and look at it. And he likes to scratch the animals on the blanket part and play with the tags now that he is a bit older.<br /><br />He loves the music and ever since he was only a couple months old he has mimicked the &#34;Where is Thumpkin&#34; song with the tones of his voice after he's played on the mat. And if he's ever in a bad mood I just start singing Where is Thumpkin (or Frere Jacques depending on my whim) and he gets a big smile on his face and loves it. This mat is great to put him on while I pump or wash his bottles etc. because it entertains him for quite awhile. I really think it helps him learn too and now he knows how to make it play music and how to scoot to get the different parts and it's been fun to watch him figure it all out. This play mat has brought so much joy to our son, who brings so much joy to us, that I can't help but highly recommend it to any parent! I feel like once our son is older I'll look back on these delightful baby years and remember a few toys that he loved so much: this play mat, his lion carseat bar toy, his bouncer, his &#34;rattle ball&#34;/activity ball, and a few favorite books.

The center of the wooden handle with string is about 12&#34; long in total. That is too short even for average height toddler. Kids do not pull toys with hands stretched all the way down.

I bought it because it was lightweight and therefore easy to move around, and also because her fingers couldn't get smashed by the cloth lid. My daughter is almost 2 now and the thing is falling apart. She loves climbing in and out of the box and hanging out/falling asleep inside, which ruins the sides and bottom after a while. In addition, she usually collapses the box (unintentionally) on her way out, so it ends up flat on the floor, so she can't put her toys back in unless someone erects the box again. There is also quite a lot of wear and tear in the corners by now, so it's getting holes. If you're looking for something temporary or just for keeping toys at Grandma's house, then this is perfect!

Living in Center City Philadelphia, it gets heavy use (about an hour each day) on uneven and brick sidewalks.  I have not had any maintenance issues so far, even after gate checking it four times without using a travel bag.  One of the great features for me has been the bassinet.  My daughter slept in it until she was 3 1/2 months old.  Now she sits in the upright seat but I still feel like we got a lot of use out of the bassinet.  It is easy to swap out seats, adjust the seat, and it's pretty easy to fold.  The large basket is great for grocery shopping if you walk to the store.  I also purchased the parent organizer and it holds an iphone, credit card, keys and a drink very well.  So far I really have no complaints about this stroller, and I've been really happy with my purchase.  If you're going to be doing a lot of travelling, this is heavy and bulky so I'd recommend getting a second stroller for travelling.

And anyone who has had a baby can tell you, you never have enough hangers.  Everyone buys you clothes for the baby.  This translates in to a lot of closet space needed and hangers are always a plus.  The wife also took the time to organize the clothing with the provided clothes dividers so we can keep track of the different sizes.

Not only for it's superior design-it looks better then any other- but also by it's superior finishing, cushioning, structure and handling. and It's easier to set it up. It does not have the configuration type of going on two wheels for all terrain/beach purposes, like others do,  but I find that very unnecessary. In the other hand it is way easier to perform everyday activities like turning the seat to face in any direction, or disassembly for storage. The stroller does cost more then most of it's competitors , but that's compensated by it's greatest advantage; the car seat base. It not only makes unnecessary to buy a extra car seat, saving an extra $200 at least, but also works way better then other seats on the market looking very stylish small and discrete on the car when not in use. It works great and fits in any car. The system comes with the car base, the stroller structure, and the infant car/baby stroller seat, for $900. The bassinet must be purchase separately for $280 and it comes with a attachment that turns it into a rocker chair. It is expensive, but the products are of quality.    The big disadvantage on the orbit system comes on the color choice, as of now it only gives 2 color options -black and mocha- with the promise of a new ruby color for 2010. The company also does not sell fabric sets for replacement . They did release a \\""green edition\\"" of the bassinet that came in a beautiful off white color made with organic \\""green\\"" cotton, but that is sold out/not in the market anymore and when it was it costed the bizarre amount of $650- more then double the regular price . I've been looking to get this for my sister that's having the baby and really dreams about it, and believe me, it's impossible to get.   It's not a very customer friendly move of the company to make it so hard for the consumer to make his choice for the stroller color, specially when direct competitors like the bugaboo's offer so manyand easy options for fabric color and fabric replacement. This is something that comes at almost no cost to the manufacturer and at great satisfaction to the customer. And to have the option at hand and release it for a limited on and off time for a absurd high price it's a cheap marketing practice, and really careless and aggressive with the customer, specially on this case when the customer is usually a mother going through all the anxieties of having her first baby. The stroller is expensive enough already, it leaves a greedy image to recur to such lame profit tactics.   I would pay the extra money for the \\""special edition\\"" color -if I could only find it- to please my sister, of course, but not without the feeling of being deceived and deluded by the company, which  I believe comes to a greater cost to their brand.",12/23/2009

I had three main criteria when selecting a new stroller; comfortable for a taller person to push (I am 5' 10\\""), storage underneath, and folds compactly (like an umbrella stroller). This product definitely meets those needs.<br /><br />However, the straps are very odd. You can't really tighten your child in it if they are smaller (9 - 24 months) without having to do some modification to the way they are setup to work. I ended up having to set this to the lowest shoulder setting and then feed it back through the top shoulder setting to tighten it up. Also, the straps get tighter as you recline your child, and seems to ride up between the legs in the harness. The first time we did this our child woke up from how uncomfortable the strap was between her legs. So if your little one falls asleep be sure to loosen the straps before initiating the recline.<br /><br />The foot adjustment is great. For us it is always up and very comfortable looking for our child. The sun shade works as well as any other stroller we have used and it is better than nothing!<br /><br />Overall it is very sturdy, seems to be well built.

Now, I had seen other reviewers say it was heavy.  When I tried it out in the store it didn't seem that bad but as I carry it around, it DEFINITELY is a heavy bag. <br /> <br />Secondly, when I fill the little compartments, there is not much room for other things a baby needs (like a blanket and a spare change of clothes).  When I add these things to the mix the bag gets \\""fat\\"" which makes it even more cumbersome to carry. <br /> <br />Thirdly, the handles are just too short.  Not only do they not fit on a stroller, but if I'm wearing a big coat (which I wasn't when I bought the bag in August), it's hard to get it over my shoulder (and I'm not a large person). <br /> <br />Because I paid so much for this bag, I will continue to carry it for a while, but for those who haven't made the purchase yet, I'd recommend looking for a bag that's just as cute, but a little more functional. <br />",12/21/2005

The only thing that concerned me was some of the negative reviews regarding installation. I can tell you with certainty that all of those reviews must have been at the hands of individuals who have never installed a car seat.  The seat was installed in less than 5 minutes and simply does not budge at all.  Get inside the car put your entire body weight on the seat by placing your knee against the lower back and pull up on the strap. Special car must be given to ensure the strap is coming across from the opposite side with no bends.  Also, make sure you are pulling the strap through the hole in the back to ensure you have the right angle for maximum tightness (pictured in the manual).

My sons were only a year apart so we previously tried everything from single full-size monsters to compact double strollers, and lugged them around until my younger boy was almost 5 (he still liked to nap unexpectedly and we had to have a place for him to do so)!  This time I decided I was not going to drag a huge, heavy, stroller around.  This is especially important since we downsized to a mini-van from a full size conversion van.  The arthritis in my hands means pain if I am juggling heavy or awkward items.<br />  This stroller is the BEST and LIGHTEST you will find.  It has all the necessary features of the big ones and a couple you don't find often.  There is an extended seat/footrest that can be raised or lowered to support your growing child's legs - so no waking up crying from that nap because little legs fell asleep and are \\""pins and needles!\\"" A \\""boot\\"" folds out from under the seat front and velcros to the (removable) childs tray. This means that you can let your smallest infant sleep laying just about flat with no fear of her sliding out the front of the stroller.  The 5-point harness is great extra security to keep little ones from hanging sideways out the stroller.  If you find yourself in a place with no convenient changing station, simply remove the child's tray and lay the stroller seat almost flat to change a diaper anywhere you need to!  The adjustable single handle makes maneuvering a breeze for tall and short caregivers alike.  The cup-holder and storage pouch in the perfect-sized canopy are both convenient and easy to use, as is the clear window to check on your precious passenger.  The stroller opens easily, stands alone, and folds flat enough that it actually stands up between the captains chair and the sliding door next to my baby's matching car seat!<br />  The car seat that goes with this system is solid, secure and compact, yet it fits my 98th percentile baby with ease.  Let's face it, if you don't have to buy multiple car seats/stroller sets, you are saving time and money.  This system will be perfect until baby is over a year old and we move to a forward facing car seat.  Then the stroller itself is the only one you'll need till you don't need any more!seat that goes with this system is solid, secure and compact, yet it fits my 98th percentile baby with ease.

We both like this bag quite a bit when you consider our divergent perspectives - this is our first child; I've not spent a lot of time around small kids, but my wife was a nanny for infants and toddlers for over ten years.  She says it's the best diaper bag she's used, period. <br /> <br />The bag makes efficient use of space along the sling, making it seem roomy.  I think the picture used for the product description makes it hard to get a good idea of the scale size of the bag - it looked small to me in the pictures, but it is not (it's not humongous either).  There's plenty of room for wipes, diapers, butt paste, change of clothes, etc. and some personal items for the carrier.  However, you are not going to get a lot of extra room in here for items that some women bring along in their purses.  On the other hand, for women who typically travel light (as my wife does), or for most guys, there is ample room for your stuff in addition to the kiddo's.     <br /> <br />The sling itself is well balanced and this method of carrying is an excellent alternative to other diaper bag styles (we've looked at all of them, believe me) because both of your hands are free and you don't have to struggle to keep it on your shoulder while you are trying to wrangle a child, stroller, etc.  Stylistically, it's a nice looking bag - a little out of the ordinary.  You certainly won't look like you are carrying a purse or something froo-froo (if that's an issue).  The bag appears to be well constructed, with seams between the compartments sewn rather than glued.  There is a plastic quick release buckle on the strap, which makes for easy attachment to strollers, etc.  The buckle appears reasonably durable and simple enough to replace should it not be. <br /> <br />The bag (and it's variously-colored Logic ilk) is the 2007 successor to the [[ASIN:B0002ZA2A6 JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag]].  The Logic bag is five dollars more (at the time of this writing), but includes a small changing pad.  reviews from the Essentials line had indicated a problem with the separation of compartments, but it appears that JJ Cole now stitches those seams and has thus improved the construction of the bag over last year's model (and perhaps in other areas as well).  Having handled or owned the Essentials version, I cannot say what the other differences may be, but I greatly appreciate and respect attention to detail and the effort to improve a good product.",5/24/2007

However, I do think the Orchestra cartridge is a good one.  In fact, I think it is superior to the Mozart's Night Music cartridge.<br />The Orchestra cartridge is a more flexible than the Mozart one which seems to favor a particular order of block arrangment.  Although the Orchestra cassette still sounds &quot;best&quot; in one or two particular orders, it does have more than one &quot;right&quot; way to order the blocks.  Also, it is not as familiar of a tune as Mozart's Night Music, so you won't tire of it as easily.<br />I also like the way that each block features a part of a traditional orchestra: trumpets, strings, percussion, etc.  This definitely makes children notice how the tone of a piece of music is affected by the choice of instrument.  I think it's a good way to introduce the idea of parts forming a harmonious whole and some of the basic concepts behind an orchestra.",9/27/2000

Last week I used my neighbors umbrella stroller (probably $15-20) and realized why my sisters gave me this advise.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The stroller handles are higher than average. My husband (6'3&#34;) and dad (6'4&#34;) both have no trouble with this and do not have to bend over at all when pushing this).<br />2. Though this is a bit bigger than your cheap-o stroller, it folds down very compact and fits easily in my trunk. it is also extremely easy to collapse and set up.<br />3. The wheels on this are good quality. We took this on a hiking path (not paved) and it worked great. It also maneuvers quite well.<br />4. There is a little compartment on the handles for a drink and a zipper pouch for storing small things.<br />5. There is a small storage compartment under the stroller. it won't fit a lot, but it's handy for smaller things.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The only thing I do not like about this stroller is that the shade is small and does not adjust. However, I just make sure I bring a hat and sunglasses for my little guy.<br /><br />This really is a fantastic stroller for a reasonable price. My little guy is now 35&#34; and 25 lb (20 month) and still fits comfortably.  You won't be sorry.",3/31/2015

The harness clasps are more sturdy and easy to use than most of the ones I looked at (what's up with Eddie Bauer? they have the worst harness buckles of all!).

It was fine at the beginning, and I mostly got it because I wanted the Keyfit 30.  However, once we started using it without the infant car seat, I knew that it wasn't going to be the stroller we would probably keep till she outgrew it.<br /><br />Pros: Obviously it fits nice with the Keyfit 30 (which we loved.) Nice storage basket underneath. Built well, and I bet will last for some time. Smooth ride on normal surfaces and turned well. I liked that it came with a tray/cup holder and storage compartment (but that is a standard with strollers in this category).<br /><br />Cons: It was getting hard to open and close as time went by. It fills my entire trunk on my Accord without room for much anything else. I definitely could not open it/put it away while holding baby. It's bulky, and the weight was starting to get to me. The sun shade is too small, especially as we live in S. Florida. I was stuck using an extension sun shade. The brake was also a bit difficult to unlatch and ruined a pair of my favorite flipflops. (I know I shouldn't have unlatched it while wearing such a shoe!)<br /><br />When I started looking for an umbrella stroller, my friends recommended that I consider selling this stroller and replacing it with something lighter all together. I looked into the BJ City Mini and the Britax B-Agile. I have since purchased the B-Agile. Had this stroller come out a year earlier, I probably would have gotten it over the travel system.

This is the situation in my home currently. In my home country, baby proofing is not really something people have ever thought of but in US, it is a pretty common thing. In order to ensure that our kid is safe when he is doing his antics in the house or learning to walk and such, we wanted to protect him from bumping his head or falling with his head banging against some furniture like the TV Stand (which is low in height) and corners of the wall cabinet.<br />This Cozy Greens Corner Cushion and Edge guard set is definitely good started kit for parents like us to start their baby proofing endeavour. This is all you get in his kit..<br /><br />18 feet of Edge Guard<br /> 8 Corner Cushions with pre-applied 3M tape<br />2 Cabinet Latches<br />6 Outlet Plugs<br />3x 3M Tape rolls<br /><br />I really like the fact that the 8 corner cushions come with a 3M Tape pre applied. Saves us some of the work. The Edge guard is 18 Feet in length and is a single continuous strip. My son loves to play with it. Appears like a snake. You can cut the edge guard as per the length of the furniture or wherever you need to put it. For these, the 3M double sided tape is not pre applied. You will need to apply it yourself.<br />Infants are always curious and one thing you don’t really want them to be curious about are the electric outlets. In order to cover you on that front, you can use the provided 6 outlet plugs to cover them and ensure your baby doesn’t insert his fingers or some other object inside them.<br />The edge cushions are pretty soft and will ensure that if you were baby were to bump on it, it won’t hurt him and the cushion will absorb the force of impact.<br />The 8 edge corners will fit most edges like dining table or centerpiece properly. If your table is not with edges or has some weird design then you can use the edge cushions / guards instead. In our case, we have used a combination of edge guardand corner cushions. Check the picture.<br />I like that it comes in a nice box so everything stays together in one place even if the main plastic in which it came tears off.<br />There are 2 cabinet latches also in the package. These are used to make sure your crawling / walking kid doesn’t open those drawers or cabinet door you don’t want them to open. Check the picture to see how it is supposed to be attached (the picture if from an earlier cabinet latch we applied which we had got a month back but it is going to be similar). The cabinet latches have 3M Double sided tapes on both ends. These 3M tapes are generally easy to remove once applied. These latches are easier to open for an adult, not so much for a child, which is the main purpose. I received this product at a discount for my unbiased honest review.",8/6/2015

I use regular Chinese prefolds with a wrap. Here are my reviews.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001H3VIOQ Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, Celery Dot, 15-30 Pounds]] : ( I actually bought the small size ) This wrap is super cute. The velcro is nice since my baby is a wiggler. The fabric is slightly thicker than any other wrap I've used. I think this might be the problem. My daughter wet through the prefold and it got on the wrap. I had to wash it 3x to get the smell out of the cover. I haven't had that problem with any of the other wraps I've used. I also would prefer a double leg gusset and this is a single.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002147J48 Kushies Taffeta Diaper Wrap Infant]] : This is an amazing price. The design is cute, it's very lightweight and it has the velcro and double leg gussets I like. But, it's very baggy. This works great over a fitted diaper and not very well over a prefold. My baby is pretty long and skinny, so that may be part of the problem. I have a few fitted diapers and like to use this wrap when she wears them. The material is much more vinyl-like than a regular pul wrap. I don't really mind it, but it might get uncomfortable in warm weather.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005KPXSQ8 Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Hoot, One]] : There's a reason this is the number on listing under cloth diapers. It's awesome. The design is great, the fit is great, the fabric is great! I do prefer velcro since my baby likes to wiggle, but that's a personal preference. The snap system is very sturdy. I like the fact you can change the size of this cover to fit different babies. With only 2 sizes, they are worth the initial price since they last so long. I haven't had any leaks and that includes a major mess my daughter made last night. It cleans wonderfully. I will be buying all Thirsties from now on.",1/6/2012

My only complaint about this bed is how difficult it was to assemble.  The instructions are very clean and there aren't many steps... but the hassle of lining up the screws with the barrel nuts was aggravating!  My only piece of advice:  turn the bed upside down.  The barrel nuts had a tendency to fall too far inside the wood and flipping the bed over allowed me to adjust how far in the barrel nut sat in the wood so I could get the screw to line in properly.

We have it in the denim color and it has worn beautifully--she's been riding in it for over a year now.  We moved our child into the RA when she outgrew her Graco Snugride. <br /> <br />Safety was (and is!) our number one priority with carseats and we really love the high rear-facing weight-limit (33 pounds) of this seat and will keep our child rear-facing as long as she is eligible.  She currently is 19 months and 29 pounds and still rides rear-facing.   <br /> <br />We have taken this seat with us on eight airplane flights and have installed it with no problems on all of those flights--and yes, she was rear-facing on those flights.  Be prepared though--having the seat rear-facing on an airplane means that the person seated in front of the carseat cannot recline their seat.  Most people have been very nice about this, but we did get some snarky comments from one flight attendant on our last flight.  Oh well--safety first! <br /> <br />We have installed it in rental cars as well as our Jeep Liberty and have had no problems with easy installation.  In our Jeep Liberty we do not have LATCH in the center position (many cars don't--and you don't want to accidentally use the LATCH from the two outboard positions if you're putting the seat in the center!!) so we use the seatbelt as well as the rear-facing tether and the seat is in there as solid as a rock!!  We've had it inspected by certified carseat safety inspectors and they have been VERY impressed with how secure the seat is. <br /> <br />Our child is very tall for her age and her days in the Roundabout are numbered, so I just ordered her a Britax Marathon to have at the ready for when she outgrows this seat.  She is 35 inches and 29 pounds at 19 months and the tips of her ears aren't at the edge of the plastic yet (one of the markers of being too tall for the seat) but they're getting close!! <br /> <br />We really do recommend this seat--we were fortunate enough to find it at one of the nationwide wholesale clubs for a bit less than it is at BRU, but it is a fantastic seat at any price.",6/24/2005

It didn't take him long to figure out that he could bounce by himself and choose when and how hard he bounced. We first used this when our son was about 3 months old (supported sitter) and we're still using it now and he's 6 months old. A few things to consider, firstly it's not easy getting baby in and out to start with but with practice that gets a lot easier and secondly, the seats height doesn't appear to adjust very much, it says in the instructions that the child should be on their tiptoes but my son, who has always been on the taller side (90th percentile), started to outgrow this within weeks. He still uses it now even though he can touch the floor with his feet flat and he still really enjoys bouncing and it doesn't seem to bother him but I don't let him use it for very long because I don't want to damage his growing bones. If the seat had a better height adjustment then this would have gotten 5 stars from me.<br /><br />Also when my son does use this he is quite rough with his bouncing and swinging and its never once looked loose or like it would fall. I also did my own testing before I allowed him in it and it held up. I feel very confident that the jumper is strong and safe.",11/16/2013

However I gave it a very careful, supervised chance and kept an eye on the cheap looking lock mechanism. The whole piece that attaches to the doorway looks cheap, and has only one setting to lock. Once locked you can still move the arms with your hands even though you shouldn't be able to. After doing numerous weight tests and seeing my son play in it, I am confident that it will not fall down. Now, five months later my son bounces in his 'car' for hours at a time and he LOVES it. I feel safe putting him in it and leaving to put in load of laundry or take something out of the oven. My son is a very active bouncer and has really given his car a run for its money. The money we spent on the car is well worth my sons squeals of delight as he is bouncing to his hearts content.<br /><br />In addition to a deceivingly unsafe hold there are a few drawbacks which I feel I need to touch on:<br /><br />There are two buttons the baby can press which make the lights flash and music play, however when a baby is in the bouncer their arms rest in the same spot where those buttons are which make both go off simultaneously and repeatedly which becomes more than a little annoying for you and very confusing for your little one. My advice: don't put the batteries in. The designers weren't using their heads when they decided to put those buttons there. There are still some soft star teethers on the front of the car which can occupy the baby's attention if they aren't into jumping just yet.<br /><br />The other thing I really don't like about the jumper is that there are three lines suspending the car in the air, then a divider and then one main line up to the lock at the door jam. The divider is pretty low down, just about 6-10 inches above the baby's head and it makes it very difficult to put baby in and take them out of the device without hitting their head on the divider.<br /><br />There are some good points too:<br /><br />The seat is a kind of faux leather which makes it great for quick clean ups and you don't have to worry about staining.<br /><br />It has an adjustable strap which is very easy to change so that you can adjust the car for the height of your growing baby.<br /><br />Lets face it...

We like this so much better than our Evenflo seat that we had previously.  I love that you can have the handle in any position when you are driving and it doesn't have to be down.  That is good if you don't have a lot of room in your car.  I also think the colors are really nice.  It would be good for a boy or a girl.  The install is really easy you can use it with the base or without.  Which is really nice for the occasional ride with the Grandparents or Daddy's car we don't have to move the base around or worry about buying a second one.  If you have a big baby this would probably be the best seat to get because there is no way they are going to outgrow this one.  I only have two criticisms.  The first being the sunshade is a little hard to work with and the second being that it doesn't fit on top of shopping carts like most other infant seats do.

It is well built and primarily made of polyester materials. It measures about 15&#34;x8&#34;x14&#34; on the outside. It doesn't look very huge but you can really pack a lot of stuff in it. It doesn't look like a diaper bag neither, unless you know that the Skip Hop brand on the red tag in front is famous for diaper bags.<br /><br />The pattern on the exterior polyester shell is attractive. The entire shell is lightly padded. Even the two side bottle pockets are lightly padded. The shell is sturdy and can stand upright on its own. The very front of the backpack has a zipper pocket (padded again) with a small, business card sized pocket inside. The front compartment is 11&#34;x9&#34;x2 and kept closed by 2 zippers with a strap handle. The compartment has side wings to keep the compartment door from flipping all the way out. Inside the compartment are two soft, rectangular pouches that take up half the compartment each. Each pouch has a carrying handle and is lightly padded. One pouch is designed to keep 2 milk bottles cool with a silver lining and insulated padding. The other pouch has an mesh side for keeping snacks, etc.<br /><br />The main compartment is very spacious, about 13&#34;x6&#34; at the base and 14&#34; tall at the back and 11&#34; tall in the front. You can put a lot of stuff in it, such as changing clothes, lotions, diapers and your own essentials. In addition, it has a nice organizer at the back - a full size pocket to store a tri-folded changing pad (included) and two half-height pockets with an elastic band in the opening (possible put lotions in there keep them upright). The main compartment is kept closed by two zippers with matching strap handles.<br /><br />The two adjustable shoulder straps are 2.5&#34; wide and are little flimsy though. They are padded but not as heavy as other regular backpacks that I have used. They could have been padded a little more for better comfort, especially when the backpack is fully loaded. They each have a 1&#34; wide stroller strap with a quick snap buckle that allows the backpack to be hung from a stroller bar. There is also a reinforced loop handle at the top for easy carrying by one hand.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great backpack for diaper use as well as regular use after the baby has outgrown it.

They fixed the tray so the baby cannot remove with feet while seated. I like the overall weight as well as how it folds but because the legs in back and wheels in front it does not sit completely level. This makes it easy for the height adjustment slot to not be enough and you must check the legs are properly positioned every time you put baby in or sometimes it will slide all the way down. This happened to me twice and now I always check. I used the height adjustment for only a short time when baby was younger. Easy to clean fabric and is durable otherwise. I still like this chair and recommend only if you do not often adjust the chair height. My baby was not hurt or barley fazed due to how the leg have a good tilt so it was more like a bumpy ride. Always use the belts. The locking position of tray leave room for your little one to turn sideways.

We were very excited! It's a really expensive gift and all for the luxury of video. Our excitement didn't last for very long. Within only a few months it began shutting off at random. Then a few weeks later, the screen stopped working completely (although the audio was still available). We called to report the problem, which for us, since we live internationally, was an even greater problem. They told us they don't do refunds, even if we are living overseas, but they will replace the monitor after they receive the broken one. What that meant for us was over a month without a monitor. We were open to the idea that maybe this was a fluke. So, since we didn't really have a choice, because the monitor was broken, we sent it back to the company. After receiving the old system, as promised, they shipped the new one to our U.S. address and we had it brought over to us. The new system lasted less than two weeks before breaking. It is now in an almost unusable state. I called again to explain to them my situation. The woman on the phone was very rude and unsympathetic. She just kept telling me they don't do refunds. I asked her to talk to her manager about it. She told me she would have her manager call me within 24 hours. That was 3 days ago.

I'm sure this works fine, but I worry that if I can't hear at all times, I wont hear her when she cries.  I know I'm just a worry wort, but I feel at ease when I can hear the baby breathing at all times.  I have taken a dark wash cloth and laid over the monitor at night, that seems to work.  I also think the night vision could be clearer.  The last Levana camera I had had a better picture, but it's discontinued, so that why I chose this one.  It was the most economical that was the closet to the Era model I used to have.  The picture during the day is great, and the sound is good, too.  I haven't had issues with range or interference at this time.  I haven't had much of a chance to test that out yet.  I like that I can zoom the camera from the monitor and that it displays the temperature.  There are a lot of advantages for purchasing this camera.  The price is good and so is the camera.  After searching for several weeks for a camera/monitor, I finally came to the conclusion that I'm not going to get everything I want in one camera.",3/9/2015

There is a 2 step depression to the door that is ripe for small toddlers to toddle down.  I tried installing a different gate, but it worked terrible.  It was right at the top of the step, which made it hard to go up or down the steps.  And it was loose because it had to go from the bannister to the hand rail.  So I tried this gate out because of its width and ability to form an concave angle (probably the wrong math term).  This lets us walk up the steps and place groceries and car seats down before going through the gate portion.  I attached a picture which probably explains the layout way better than I can.<br /><br />I just installed this gate.  It did take a few hours, but that was all me figuring out how to screw in the anchors into my oak railing and bathroom door frame (it was the only configuration possible with our front door).  Otherwise, the thing is already assembled and you just have to place it on the anchors.  I probably should wait a few weeks to rate this, but I already love the gate.  The door closes automatically unless you push it out all the way, which is perfect for those times you want to bring in a bunch of groceries or elderly relatives.  If you need to bring in bigger stuff like furniture, you can easily pick up half the gate off its anchors to swing the whole thing wide open.  Or you can pick up the entire gate and put it aside.  It feels very sturdy and not cheap at all.",6/19/2015

It's like a tank in the backseat.  Seems much sturdier than his bucket seat. My favorite feature is that it has so many cushions.

Therefore, I specifically looked for a car seat with head support, and this one is it! He is 13 months old. He screamed in his infant bucket seat. He screamed in his hand me down convertible seat. But for the first time he sits quietly in the back seat. It's like he is surrounded by clouds. I believe he is very comfortable. I wish I had found this seat when he was an infant.

I like the window in the canopy so that you can check on your child and also the abundance of cup holders for baby and parent.  However, after about a week of using and storing in my garage, one of the wheels went flat. We pumped it up and it went flat again before we got half way down the block.  So now we have to make the time to examine it and figure out what the problem is. What a bummer since we only got to use it for a week before something like this happened.  Update on 8/24: We took this stroller to Santa Cruz for a weekend trip and it held up very nicely. However, I am noticing that when my son, who is just centimeters shy of 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 30 pounds, sits in here, he barely has any room to bend his legs to rest his feet in the tiny triangle of a resting place. I'm assuming that's how he is to position his feet since otherwise they would just be dangling off of the stroller.  His knees are less than an inch from the bottom of his tray. So, even though he still has 20 pounds to go to reach max limit on this (I think it's 50lbs...), he will more than likely stop fitting comfortably before he gets to that point.

Lots of people say they are nice and soft and they are if you touch it to your hand or face. Just not for my very sensitive nipples. So, pores have opened up in my nipples to allow for milk flow (not sure if everyone has such gaping pores.) The trouble is the terry cloth material. It's soft...but when a strand of terry pokes into my pores it makes me want to punch someone in the face and I find it unavoidable.

I was a little hesitant buying this one because of the wide seat and my vehicle is only 2-door, but I'm glad that I went and made the purchase. I have him in the back middle seat and due to no room in the 2-door backseat, it is a little tricky to get him out. Would be easier if he was on one side of the back seat or I had a 4-door vehicle. But the straps are so easy to attach and de-attach, tighten with the turn of a handle, easy to recline, and it is actually vary easy to remove him since the straps have a memory thingy. I look forward to the moment that we change the seat to forward facing since it's going to be so easy to just pop him in and go. My son loves this seat as well. Everytime I put him in it, he goes to sleep, which he never did in the infant car seat. And with the fabric being soft and plush, and the motorcycle helmet like padding under the the fabric, I have the piece of mind that his mind will be well protected.    Remember: make sure the car seat is installed properly. Most accidents that happen to children are due to incorrectly installed car seats. I went and had mine professionally checked out. Why put him in a car seat that is intended to protect him if I didn't have it installed correctly, and could actually harm him? I give this car seat a 5-star rating for ever feature.

The toilet lock stuck to the lid just fine, but didn't stick to the side of the bowl.

I know own two of them and have been using our first orb for 3 months.  We will heat milk in either medela or our avent naturals bottles.  The warmer has a removable ring that fits in the opening for skinny bottles (medela).  At our house this ring is constantly in and out of the warmer since our bottles are 2 different sizes.  It is a bit of a pain to get lined up right, but it works great to accommodate the different bottle sizes.  I have noticed that a bit more water is needed to heat our large 9 oz avent bottles compared to the 4 oz bottles because the opening is not as tight due to the bottle shape.  The instructions have a guide on how much water to use and generally it is close to accurate.  It is a bit strange that it will say to fill the water vial to 4, 2x when there is an 8 on the vial.  I do like how the vial slides into the back of the warmer so you always know where it is.

(After WE fixed it),"We test drove this stroller in the store for several months before actulally buying it. So after 9 1/2 months of use here are my thoughts. First the cons:  The biggest issue we had was that the second time we used the stroller the front wheels began to stick and our very easy-to-steer stroller became awful and  unmanageable. I was ready to send it back when by chance my dad suggested spraying some silicone lubricant ( find it near the wd40 in any store like home depot) on the part of the wheel that pivots. Thank goodness we tried this!!!! It worked and we have had no wheel-sticking issues since. (I think this may be an issue for any type of strollers bc my best friend also had trouble with the front wheels of her stroller, different brand, and this trick also fixed the issue.) The other downside is there is no \\""parent console\\"", but you can easily attach one. We found one at babies r us that works great. I think the basket is a little small and I wish you could access it from the front too, but this is totally manageable and wasn't a deal breaker for me.    The pros:  I can fold it up and load it into the car one handed! This was really important to me and this stroller is lightweight enough for me to hold our wiggley 10 month old and load it up into the car. I like the harness. It is hard to tell in the pic, but it actually unhooks from the back so baby can lean forward and remain fully strapped in. I love the removable tray. I like that when it is folded it stands well on its own. The sun shade extends very far down and provides more sun protection than a lot of other brands. This was another reason we wanted a peg perego. It has the option for clicking in  an infant car seat ( only peg perego ones will fit though I believe. ) so that is a plus if you're looking for a lightweight travel system. The stroller is sturdy and has held up very well so far. We go to the zoo lot and it has made many trips to Disneyland already. So far so good. Another plus is the color. Ilike that we can pick out our stroller in a crowd. The handle bar is a good height. My husband is 6'3\\"" and he can comfortable push with out hunching over. My mom is 5'2\\"" and she can push is comfortably too.    I would have given it 5 stars If:  1.) it had a parent console   2.) if the basket was more accessible when the back is recline  3.) if we hadn't had the wheel issue (though it was easily resolved thanks to good old dad)    Hope this helps!    Update 8/19/2014  We are now using this stroller for child #2 and it has held up amazingly well over the last 3 years! I got gutsy and used my screw driver and removed the seat so I could really give it a good washing and it went back together no problem. The initial wheel issue hasn't happened since, though every few months I wipe down the wheel areas and give it a new squirt of silicone lubricant. I can say this was a fantastic purchase and we are for sure getting our money's worth out of it. I still agree with my initial review. Happy stroller hunting and don't stress yourself out with all the options out there. :)",2/20/2012

My nipples are inverted and very small in diameter (I've been told several times that they look like 'mosquito bites'), so my hopes were that they would become wider too, which didn't happen.  That's okay though because they are definately not inverted anymore.  And an unexpected perk is that they are more sensitive now.  I started using the niplettes because I want to have a baby soon, but the cosmetic change has given me tons more confidence.  And for some reason I am happier now with the overall shape and size of my breasts.  The only drawbacks would be that they are hard to keep in place if you are not wearing a tight, padded bra (at least with my A-cup size).  A padded bra is a must to keep the niplette concealed as it is about as big and rigid as a thimble.  I got some water in the tubing of one of them while washing, and I can't get it out even when using the plunger to push it out, so be careful to cover the end of the tube when washing.  Also, I try to apply a little more suction to the nipple in the middle of the day as they are less sensitive at that point than when you first put the nipplettes on.  It took a while to find the perfect amount of vaseline to use - too little and you don't get a good suction seal, too much and the niplette will slide around in your bra and eventually pop off.  It took about a week to get to where I could where them all day without having to constantly check and adjust.  This is totally worth it though.  I'm actually very upset that after all the breast exams I've haven since my teenage years, not one doctor ever recommended this product.  Good luck ladies!",5/19/2011

The day I had to bring my newborn home, I had no idea what I was doing with the buckles.  We actually put the seatbelt on the baby completely wrong, gave up and I held the baby in the seat on our short ride home! (Not recommended).  I am not saying this to discourage you to buy this seat, rather I think you should educate yourself on how to put an infant into a car seat well in advance of the day you decide to take the baby home from the hospital!!!  Since then, obviously we figured it out. And now we love this carseat.<br /><br />I own both the Boulevard CS 70 and the Marathon versions of the Britax seats.  The Boulevard is considerably more &#34;luxe&#34; than the Marathon. I like that the seatbelt clicks. At first, I hated it because I felt like it was way too constricting when it squeezed against my baby. But now I feel like I need that comfort of the click to know the seat belt is on properly.  The Marathon that I have does not have the click feature, and I never feel like it's on tight enough.<br /><br />We decided to not go with the infant carrier seat, and I am very happy with my decision to not get one (despite a lot of protests from my friends).  A few words of advice for those of you choosing to use only one convertible car seat from birth until they outgrow the seat...<br /><br />1.) Newborns need a full recline! Otherwise their heads roll forward and can constrict breathing.  We had to get towels and prop the seat up so that the seat would fully recline properly in our car<br /><br />2.) When the seat is rear facing, and in newborn recline mode, it may not fit in your car right. Especially if you are tall people that require the driver seat and passenger seats pushed all of the way back.  My husband is 6'4&#34;.  This is a problem for us, because the seat couldn't recline completely and thus, the baby's neck was constricted.  We actually bought a new car all because of this!!! Not exactly the most economical approach, but we wanted a new car anyhow.<br /><br />3.) The cushions are essential to get with your convertible car seat so that you can properly get a ball of a newborn baby to fit into the seat right.<br /><br />4.) I highly recommend getting one of those inserts that wraps around the baby's head so that the head doesn't fall from side to side.  That was a huge problem for me at first because of the lack of neck and head control in those first months.<br /><br />5.) If you are in a bumpy ride (think a Jeep wrangler, or a sporty subaru impreza with stiff shocks), then don't get a seat like this for a newborn. Their head is going to bounce all over the place in the car seat.<br /><br />6.) It takes some practice to maneuver the newborn into the car seat because of the lack of head control.  You have to sort of hold the baby horizontal, and slide them into the car seat sideways. It's annoying but possible.<br /><br />Overall, it's possible to do this from birth on, but there are definitely considerations that need to be made when making that choice!",11/7/2013

Install was easy and rock-solid.    Although the Boulevard \\""looks\\"" huge in the store, it's OK once installed rear-facing because the base is very compact. Also, this car seat has a small footprint so it doesn't hang off the edge.    Side to side, the Marathon and the Boulevard are about the same size. The Boulevard is actually smaller than the Graco Sport car seat, which has a very large base and could not be secured tightly in the Forester. Seat depth from the back to the crotch strap is 6\\"" for the Marathon, 6.5\\"" for the Boulevard and 7\\"" for the Roundabout, so if you have a boy, go for the Boulevard.    Although the front passenger seat of my car is moved forward more than I'd like, I can still sit there in a pinch (I'm 5'8\\"" and my knees are 2\\"" from the glove compartment, with the seat very upright). In back, the car seat takes up the whole right seat (there's not much of a \\""center seat\\"" anyway), so there's really only room for an adult behind the driver. I must clarify that this happens with any car seat I've tried - the problem is the size of the back seat, not the car seat.    The Boulevard car seat will not fit rearfacing behind the driver's seat in my small car. Front-facing, the size of the Boulevard is not an issue.    As with any Britax, the front passenger seat should not be moved or reclined after the car seat is installed - it could interfere with the back tether, the angle of the car seat and the clearance between the back of the front seat and the Britax (there must be about an inch or two fingers, to allow the car seat some give in case of a crash). Follow the manual's instructions to make sure the seat is level - there's a red line on the base as a guide.    The Boulevard also fits well in a Honda Accord, Nissan XTerra, Toyota Rav4 and Lexus SUVs. However, if your car is really, really small and you want that side impact protection, try the Britax Diplomat, about the size of the Roundabout but with wings and a 40 lb. maximum weight limit. If the Diplomat doesn't work, and you need a rear-facing seat, it's time for a minivan.",5/23/2009

The Graco is lighter, more portable, questionable safety IMO, easier to strap baby in, and of course, cheaper. Also, my boy outgrew the Graco a long time ago, but is still using the peg perego.

All the things that made FuzziBuns far superior, BumGenius borrowed for this design. The availability of snaps means that you can use your diapers for a second child (the velcro does NOT last on velcro tabs of any brand - DO NOT GET VELCRO) and active babies don't rip off their snap diapers (wrangling them into the snaps, of course, is why some people like velcro - but not so great when they choose to rip off velcro and do their business on the nice rug). The biggest improvement is the replaceable elastic - something FuzziBuns introduced a while back. This is the number one reason my older cloth diapers \\""pooped\\"" out (and I mean that in oh so many ways).     So, the remaining differences (and here I'm talking about the latest versions of both - November 2010):  I think FuzziBuns are softer and stay softer after washing.  I think BumGenius stay drier longer.  I think BumGenius are better for bigger babies (the FuzziBuns fit my ginourmous second child fine still, but I wonder exactly what is going to happen when he's 3 given that he weighs almost 30 pounds and is not yet 1).   I think BumGenius are much more difficult to wash (the pocket has an end flap. When you use the BumGenius sprayer - which rocks BTW - all the poop gets caught in the pocket. If you spray toward the closed end of the pocket, the water gets in but takes forever to drain out so my wash bucket gets all full of water and the \\""waterproof\\"" BumGenius liner eventually leaks. The FuzziBuns spray off much easier, no poop goes in the pocket, and they don't hold so much water) and tend to hold smell longer (they need to be stripped more often).     With the new 4.0 version, I think the difference is mostly preference - but I'm sticking with FuzziBuns as my primary diaper.",11/17/2010

I absolutely LOVE the hands free  bra. At first it was a bit intimidating, it looked thick and bulky,  and lots of zippers. Then I figured it out. he sturdy fabric made me  feel secure.

(trust me I'm not that talented, but I'm sure there are moms who are)  It felt better on than some of my regular nursing bras, the support  was nice, and I'm pretty heavy chested, and I thought that I could  possibly even wear it alone as a strapless. I think the velcro in the  back is nice because it enabled me to adjust the tightness. It's not a  specific size, it can be changed from \\""post-deliver\\"" body to \\""look at  me\\"" body with one bra. I must say it's been wonderful using it. I even  put it on and pumped in the car on the way home from shopping the  other day!    I'd also like to thank you for having a color/color option. I think  nursing white isn't always the best color choice in bras/accessories.  The light pink is just the right color and isn't dingy after a few  uses.

If you're looking for a safe, secure seat with a sunshade, this is by far the most popular and least expensive one on the market. The lap harness and head rest make even our newborn sit very securely (3 week old, 7.5 pounds). I can't wait to use it outside this spring with the sunshade. Also, the toy bar adjusts up and down, so we are able to put it low enough to be closer to her hands rather than her face. When she gets bigger, we can raise it accordingly. The toys are well within reach as soon as she's ready to start reaching! They're also high quality and very fitting for even a newborn's small fists.       If you're looking for something with an endless variety of music and lights, this doesn't have it. It does play one song, and also has a heartbeat and a waterfall recording, but they both sound, well, recorded. The bonus, though, is there is volume control, and the music sounds decent. Personally, I was trying to find something withOUT all the bells and whistles, and therefore lower priced. (If we want music, I'll put on the stereo.) The seat also has a nice vibration, though our newborn found it a little overwhelming. She'll probably love it in a couple months. When she kicks, it already rocks her a little, despite how small she is.",12/16/2003

Wish the sound was better though...,"We got this monitor a few weeks back when we finally decided to crib train. We had been cosleeping before, but it was time.<br /><br />Mainly, we got this monitor because our son will often make fussing noises in his sleep, or will fuss for a minute or so without actually waking. This meant that with our sound only monitor ([[ASIN:B000S35QLC NTM-910YLW - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor]]) we had several false alarms throughout the night, and sometimes even woke him up as we went to his room, when he would have just gone to sleep by himself had we not entered his room. With this unit we can monitor our son and see if we genuinely need to go into his room or if he is fine.<br /><br />I have only TWO complaints about this product:<br />- The sound doesn't get loud enough. I'm a fairly heavy sleeper now that we aren't cosleeping anymore. I have had to use this monitor in conjunction with our Sony baby monitor because the sound is clearer on that unit and the volume can be turned up a lot louder.<br />- The battery does not last long. If we use this monitor at night it has to be plugged in or else it will die at some point in the night. It is good unplugged for our son's naptime in the day, which is normally 2-3 hours long. After that, if we try and turn it on later at bedtime without plugging it in, it dies and shuts off within a few minutes.<br /><br />I want to say, the VOX setting no longer makes beeping noises. I saw some reviews complaining of that, and others saying that it did not have that particular feature. I can confirm that. Both the sound AND the infared have an auto setting, and its easy to adjust those settings.<br /><br />Other than that, no complaints. it was extremely easy to set up, The video is clear and there is very little delay in the video monitor, the signal works well for us (we have a 2 story home), and the infared vision is the bomb diggity.

I got this pump so that I could prevent engorgement when my milk was coming in (which it did admirably) and so that I could put some in my freezer so I could be away from my baby occasionally (mamas need to go to the gym and have date nights every once in a while!).  It took me about a week to figure out the pumping schedule that best worked for my production and how to maximize my let-down reflex while pumping, but once I did, I was able to get about 3oz in 20 minutes.  This wouldn't be adequate for a working mom, but it works great for me.  I didn't start pumping for the freezer until my baby was about nine weeks old, at which point my milk supply was exactly matched to her appetite.  I had no problem using the pump to increase my production so that I can stash 3-6oz every day.<br /><br />So, this pump works well.<br /><br />However, there are a couple of things to be aware of:<br />1) The company is not WHO-code-compliant (specifically, the International Code of Marketing of<br />Breast-milk Substitutes).

I do love how it has a sectioned basket underneath so you can access the stuff from the front or the back, the material is great so if there is a spill it is easy to wipe off.  My son LOVES the little steering wheel.  The parent tray is awesome, it has 2 cupholders and the little compartment for your IPOD and if you don't want to put your IPOD in it, it can hold your keys.  It isn't too heavy and it takes up the same amount of room in my car as the Graco Stroller.  The only thing I have found so far is that the Green color is a little bit brighter than in the picture.

This is my first Graco car seat purchase besides the infant carrier that I used for both of my children when they were newborns. This is the 2nd booster seat I've ever purchased and the very first backless booster.<br /><br />I wanted to have an extra booster seat available for taking my child's friends along for playdates occasionally and didn't want to spend a lot of money so I went into the store hoping to buy the cheapest booster that would do the job in a pinch. Once I got to the store, and saw and felt the cheapest options available, I knew I couldn't feel good about letting my child or someone else's child sit in them.<br /><br />The Graco Backless TurboBooster was the one most prominently displayed on the \\""wall of car seats\\"" and it felt really sturdy and had a decent amount of cushion to the seat - something I would feel good about my kid sitting in, both for safety and comfort. The Graco Affix was just one space over from the TurboBooster and didn't have all the fun patterns and color options but I wanted to see what was different about it so I picked it up. LATCH! I'd never seen a booster with LATCH before! I'd read some safety reviews in the past about how booster seats could become dangerous projectiles in the case of an accident if the seat is unoccupied/unbuckled so I was pretty excited about the LATCH feature and marched right up to the front of the store to buy the Affix.<br /><br />What I love about the Graco Affix: That it has the LATCH feature, plus it's sturdy/substantial feeling, and seems like it could be comfortable for a little kid's bottom for a good amount of time.<br /><br />What my kid loves about the Graco Affix: He feels like a really big kid, the cup holder is awesome, the hidden pull out drawer is super awesome, the seat is comfy AND...for the first time he can buckle himself in with the regular seatbelt!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product for a safety and budget conscious family with a child who is old enough to be able to sit safely in a backless booster seat :)",4/12/2013

OK fine, we could use it during the day, and use the 2nd camera to view the babies by panning back-and-forth at night.  Even doing this doesn't always work well, because the video and audio are periodically & too frequently chopping.  It also interferes badly with the wifi in the house, which makes it really annoying when you're working from home, as you always have to turn the monitor off & on if you want to use the wifi.  Since we purchased prior to our babies' arrival, by the time these issued were identified, it was too late to return to Amazon.

Four out of the five carrying devices I've tried were gifts, hand me downs or, as in this case, given to me free in exchange for writing an unbiased review. I was very excited that a customer representative emailed me with a link to a series of tutorial videos which aided me greatly in figuring out how to use this ring sling. It was fairly easy to figure out how to use it from watching a few short tutorials. Of course, it is going to take me some time to get it down just right and feel completely comfortable wearing it but so far so good. I have seen other ring slings for obscene prices. While I did get this for free for writing my unbiased review, I find the $67 price tag to be reasonable for this type of baby product. I would recommend this to others.

He would jump on it nonstop if I let him. He was 5 1/2 months when I got it and he is on the 95 percentile for his weight/height and this was the ONLY one that fitted his chubby legs without hurting him because the seat is fabric only, it doesn't have the plastic rim. That being said it does not rotated as the \\""Exersaucer\\"" did (plastic on plastic rotation), my son could do it easily on that one and not at all on the Jumperoo, so I had to rotate him to get to the different toys. (Not that he cared much, he would just jump and hit whatever he was facing.) The first day he pulled on the monkey/rhino the plastic bent and I taught it would brake soon, but it held pretty well. Another review said something about them not staying, they each have a specific spot so if you have them switched (like I had it first) they won't stay.

It seemed fine to me but she found strap pulling to set shoulder harness tighter, requiring more force than Recaro.  For petite women this matters apparently.  When she released shoulder harnesses,  'full length' the buckle got lodged into the slot for the straps.  When that happens, then it requires you to remove the seat from the car and yank that out.  See photo.  Now, I personally think this is manageable but suggest Britax mount that Y connector onto something which is too big to slide up into that hole.  She thought the Y connector did not allow shoulders to tighten evenly and it did look like the left side was coming in and the right side was more loose.  Side by side with Recaro, she thinks the recaro is better and, well, she's the mom so back it goes.  I have no special interest in Recaro, just saying what happened.",8/27/2015

One night it alarmed and I noticed that my son wasn't breathing at all. I shook him and called to him and eventually got him to wake up and start breathing again. I took him to the pediatrician and they gave him a hospital grade monitor that kept track of how often he would stop breathing and alarm. My son was later diagnosed with sleep apnea. I am terrified to even think of what would have happened without this monitor.<br /><br />That was two years ago and we have since had another child. I, obviously, wanted to use it again but knew I would need to replace the battery. So I ordered a new battery that was designed for this product. Unfortunately I changed the battery and it worked for a day and then stopped. I thought the battery was defective and ordered another from a different supplier. Unfortunately the EXACT same thing happened. So I am now convinced that the unit is defective. I am relieved that it worked with our son but disappointed that I could not use it again.<br /><br />I did order another Snuza to replace the one that no longer works. This time I ordered a Snuza Go, since the only difference is that it doesn't have the vibration feature and I didn't feel that it helped anyway.<br /><br />We have previously used Angel Care monitors but the new ones require an absurd amount of precision in the setting of the sensitivity and with five other kids in the house setting it high enough means it doesn't work as intended. All in all I would recommend the Snuza and just pay special attention to the battery. I hope it helps other families as much as it helped ours.",8/30/2012

I was learning a little bit about the amazing properties of wool for wool covers over diapers to keep baby dry and how breathable it was. I never heard of wool dryer balls. Do you have any idea how long cloth diapers can take to dry fully? You also can't use the chemical covered dryer sheets or they make your cloth diapers rather ineffective! One would think, just don't put the dryer sheets in with the cloth diapers, however the dryer sheets coat the machine in their junk as it turns out. Oh yes, I learned the hard way. This left us with not being able to use dryer sheets at all, for years, and had to deal with the static and hard clothing. It was far from ideal!<br /><br /> Next baby came, and it was much the same. Only this time I really fell in love with wool and all it's amazing properties. I still though hadn't heard about Dryer Balls.<br /><br /> Next baby, and finally the Dryer Ball movement had found it's way to me! Cloth diaper and laundry bliss! Soft clothing, no static, and no chemicals!<br /><br /> I have 6 balls already and am so glad to add these 4 new ones. They are solid, no scent, have not put fuzz on our clothing, and no chemicals! Everyone should have these! If you love scented laundry, just add a few drops of essential oils to the dryer balls. Really though, these are a much better solution for drying clothing. They are eco-friendly too as they help your clothing dry faster! Try these! 4 balls are good for a small load of laundry, add more for larger loads!<br /><br /> Disclaimer: I was given this product for my honest opinion!",3/20/2015

It has been my obsession since my baby was born 10 months ago and I stopped carrying \\""normal\\"" purses because of the wear and tear babies put on your things. I am a purse girl and not willing to have my baby teethe on a Louis Vuitton. Not going to happen... So, I'm always searching for the perfect diaper bag.<br /><br />I started with a Jujube Be Hip but it definitely looks like a diaper bag. What I like about the Behave is that it has the great Jujube mom features that the Be Hip has, but it is soooo much more stylish! My favorite things are the key clip, front pocket (my cell phone and lip glosses fit great), sippy cup pocket, and sunglasses pocket. Inside I fit a Be Quick pouch with diaper changing materials, a wipes case with clorox wipes, my wallet, a few toys, baby sun hat, and then a few variable items depending on our outing. I also keep a sippy cup in the sippy pocket and sunglasses in the sunglasses pocket. It's a little small to use as a FULL day out bag where you need lots of things like multiple meals, snacks, outfits, or several toys. I would probably use my Be Hip for that. For a few hours out of the house this one is great and actually encourages me to pack a little more lean. The earth leather does not look cheap (I have the steel grey) and I have snooty taste when it comes to leather. It looks very sharp.

He loved the colors of the dinosaurs and the rotation was slow enough to soothe him and help him go to sleep during napime. The music didn't seem to help until he was 4 months old - the songs are slow, but seem to work, and although I didn't care for them at first, they kind of grew on me. I like that there is an option to play the music (or not play it). Since he outgrew the sleeper a couple of months ago, we moved the mobile to the changing table, and that has worked wonders! Even now at 7 mo old, anytime he is upset while we're changing him, we turn the mobile on and he calms down. He still likes to look at (and now grab) the dinosaurs, whether the mobile is on or not. About the clamp - I'll admit, I was concerned about it on the wood bar of the changing table, but to my surprise, it hasn't made any indentations or marks in the wood; the clamp is tight enough to keep the arm of the mobile up and stable.

Not sure of the exact weight without the base  but it is heavy. Add a 10 pound baby and it's VERY heavy. Keep in mind that this seat is meant for longer backward facing. So if it's VERY heavy with a 10 pound baby imagine it with a heavier baby. Our 1 1/2 yo is now 24 pounds and we rarely take the seat out with him in it. We only do if he's asleep and we don't want to risk waking him. Additionally, The balance indicator shows that the ball bearing has to be in the red zone at a certain weight. The instruction book tells you  that if after adjusting the tilt of the base the ball bearing still isn't in the proper zone to use a &#34;pool noodle&#34;. Seriously? Something in my gut told me that was just wrong. Also On more than one occasion the release lever that makes it possible to remove the seat from the base has gotten stuck. No matter how many ways we strapped the base in it always sits crooked. Keep in mind that this is only the case when using the seatbelts to strap it down. We have not used the other method (the anchors) because we wouldn't be able to position the car seat in the middle of the backseat as you're supposed to do.  I purchased this car seat because of the safety rating it received by consumer reports however I am just not confident in the rating. It IS a sturdy and heavy car seat but I just can't wrap my head around the instruction book saying to use a &#34;pool noodle&#34; to achieve proper tilt and the release lever sticking randomly. For those reasons we are looking for a different seat.  Additionally the seller packed this seat terribly.  It was placed in plastic and then a cardboard box.  No bubble wrap. No styrofoam.

He laughs and laughs each time he is successful. However, I do have safety concerns as my child has also slipped off the side of the chair and was left hanging with just the waist strapped in. Thankfully I was right there and could pick him up right away. I found that folding hand-towels on either side of him helped him stay upright for the first two months or so. Now he can hold himself up much better. Also, I think the music is pretty darn annoying but that seems to come with the territory when it comes to kid's toys.

If you didn't birth a toddler, and instead were blessed with a super tiny Hobbit baby as we were, then you NEED the Britax Head and Body Support Pillow so he/she will fit better in this car seat. We rode around with our itty bitty Hobbit child for about a week before we realized we could buy the support pillow and relieve ourselves of the anguish of looking in the rear view mirror and seeing his head hanging to the side and his body looking so uncomfortable. After we got the pillow insert, he sits much more comfortable and his head stays upright.

It is more portable but you have to continually re-clip the back of the Breast shield connectors, especially when it's in the quick mode as it looses suction. The milk also does not drain well when in quick mode, you have to keep an eye on it. Plus I've been told its not good to shake the milk as this can denature the good proteins, but because it does not drain down well the milk stays in the connectors and shakes all around.

Then I came accross the baby bonkie and thought I would give that a try as it had become clear to us that a big reason for the baby's frequent waking was his flailing arms. We had tried swaddling (using the extra large \\""ultimate receiving blanket\\"") but he would just kick that off, leaving him without a blanket and with flailing arms once again.

Pros: Converts to booster, steel frame, reasonable price, deeper sidewings.  Cons: Agree that this is very heavy - I would not be likely to carry this backpack-style (I would likely buy a 3rd lighter convertible if I needed to take this on a plane).  Simple in terms of the # of pieces, though looking at all of the straps tucked in the back was overwhelming at the beginning.<br /><br />Installation was the worst.  I was installing it forward-facing in a Ford Escape with the LATCH system with the tether (for child &#60; 40 lbs).  Visibility around the seat is fine.  I had to remove the headrest in order for the tether to attach tightly.  The manual is not particular about how the LATCH strap is threaded through.  My advice is if it seems tough to get tight (as in you can still lift the seat up by 5-6 inches), flip it around - at first I had the tightening buckle on the left side, but didn't work until I switched that to the right side.  Other tip is that you should thread the strap back through the slot in the seat cover in order to get the best angle for tightening.  Once I switched it and then jammed all my weight into the seat while pushing the seat towards the car seat back, and while pulling upward/slightly in on the strap, then I got it very tight.  You should be pulling so hard that you're worried that you might break it.  After that, the seat doesn't budge at all.<br /><br />The harness straps seem like a learning curve as they're different from other seat styles, but seem sturdy enough.",6/17/2015

So far, we've used this monitor for about a month with just the older child, and are more than satisfied.<br /><br />The best aspect of this device, from my perspective, is the portability of the monitor.  It's about the size of your typical cell phone, so it can easily be slid into a pocket and carried around the house to listen in as you go about your day.  We used to use one of the old Summer video monitors that looked like a little miniature cathode-ray-tube TV.  Those took up a lot of space and had to stay within cord-reach of the wall outlet.  The freedom afforded by this monitor, then, is almost worth the price alone.<br /><br />The range seems to be pretty good.  The kids are on the second floor, and I've gotten clear sound and image throughout both our first floor and our basement.  Even get good reception outside.<br /><br />The intercom feature has also been extremely useful.  Our oldest has a little fear of the dark, and if he wakes up in the middle of the night he likes a little reassurance that we're there and that he's okay.  Used to have to climb out of bed and trudge to his room.  Now we can have a conversation and comfort him without having to lift our heads from our pillows.<br /><br />My one hesitation before choosing this monitor came from the many reviews mentioning a short battery life.  So far I haven't experienced as such.  The monitor keeps running on its battery throughout the 2 to 3 hour naps that it's been put through, but I've never had an opportunity to try it for a longer period of time.  My best recommendation would be to keep it plugged in at night.  Make the nightstand the charging station, basically.<br /><br />Overall, we're satisfied with this monitor.  Once the newbie is spending nights in his own bed, and we have the chance to really use the dual-camera mode, I'll update this review if necessary!",12/23/2014

The fabric quality of this bag is great and my car seat fit in this perfectly.  My only negative on this bag is that it does not roll smoothly and evenly when pulling it.  Although I probably had way too much in my hands while going through the airport, I found that the bag would constantly tip to the side and I was having to stop and put it back on the wheels.  It was definitely more convenient than the non wheeled bag would have been but they need to fix the construction so it can be pulled easier behind you.  Keeping in mind that you're probably pushing a child in a stroller, carrying a diaper bag and pulling this seat (as I was).

I'm going to try again but I don't have much hope. As some have said, diaper changes in this thing are amazing and there is no escaping, so when he sleeps in it he sleeps beautifully. The problem is getting him to sleep in it--4/10 times he just won't. My only design complaint is the mesh.

We got it at a discounted price, but I think it would be worth the full price as well.  My baby has spent much time enjoying this and we've only had it for 2 months.  My baby was only 3 months when we got it and I really didn't think he would enjoy it until he was a little older, but the first time I put him on it he was very interested in the toys.  He accidentally bumped one with his hand and then was fascinated trying to get a hold of them.  Also he loves talking to himself in the mirror.  I have been very happy with this purchase.  To address some of the negative comments let me say. 1. It is possible to fold this as shown,  it's not extremely intuitive or as easy as they make it sound on the package, but it is possible.  2.  Yes, be prepared the first time you turn the know to &#34;collapse&#34; it.  It is a bit surprising.  3.  No it doesn't have lots of &#34;bells and whistles&#34; but it's meant for small infants.  I'm not sure that a newborn needs lights and music on every toy they own.  4.  No the pillow isn't great, but I didn't purchase the toy for the pillow.  And no the pillow doesn't attach to the mat as the directions state.  The editor must have been on vacation.  The things I really like about this are,  1. You could use this from day one with your baby 2. The included toys are soft and switchable.  You could put any toy with a link on this. 3. Foldable for storage and/or travel.  Also it seems pretty durable.  My toddler is also interested in it and can get a little rough and it has withstood that so far.  I haven't washed it yet, so I can't comment on that, but the fabric is nice and wipeable. I usually put a burp rag under my baby when he is on this anyway",1/8/2014

I bought this thinking that I would be able to use it until she was 35lbs. Most children will outgrow this seat b/c of height (approx 32\\"") before they even get CLOSE to 35lbs. My sister bought a Snugride 32 for her little boy about a year after I bought this for my daughter. And, I prefer the 32 b/c it is narrower and lighter. The Snugride 35 is so wide that it doesn't fit well in a restaurant high chair turned upside down and it is just a good bit bulkier in general than the 32. The Graco Snugride is good to 22lbs (not sure about the height on it).  Don't get me wrong, I used it for a year and have no complaints about it's functionality. It works well with the Graco Car Seat stroller frame and has a nice canopy and safety features. It's just that at 30in tall (and only 22lbs) my daughters head is within 1\\"" of the top of the shell and I have purchases a convertible car seat.  My advice - go with an infant seat up to 22lbs, which is cheaper than the SnugRide 35 (its SO nice to be able to take the baby out of the car w/o having to unhook the 5pt harness) and get a convertible seat when they outgrow it. At around 7 months, I stopped taking my daughter out of the car in this seat anyway because it was just too heavy and difficult to do with her in it.  If I could do it over again, I would get just the small Graco Snugride or Snugride 32 and switch to a Graco MyRide 65 (which we bought to replace our infant seat) when she outgrew it.",8/27/2011

I only have one, and I could see that two would be nice, but for the price, I don't really need two.  I usually hang mine up to dry but it seems to do just fine in the dryer.  The wings are long enough to tuck in, but not so long that you're tucking forever.  It really stays in place nicely and my daughter seems very comfortable on it.  I would buy this again.... and probably will with baby #2 on the way!!!",4/29/2008

I have been using the madela pump for about 3 months and I really LOVE it.  This pump is easy to clean, lightweight, comfortable, easy to use, very effective, and compact (fits nicely into a purse).  Also it is still in great condition--has not broken or had any defects yet.  I am able to pump about 8 ounces in 20-30 minutes without my nipples hurting and without my hand getting sore from pumping.  I use this pump full-time; my son has been in day care for about a month, and I still have no problem pumping with this manual pump 3 times a day.  I'm even able to check email and get some reading done while I pump at work.  The Evenflo comfort select manual pump is larger and more difficult to actually pump (my hand gets tired with the evenflo pump after about half-way through pumping).  I also like how this (the madela pump) doesn't leak around the cone that fits over the breast.  It makes a good seal and keeps all of the milk in as long as you don't tip it backwards (i.e. don't pump while leaning back or slouching in a chair).  The evenflo cone leaked all over me.  For someone who has to go back to work and pump full time, but cannot afford an electric pump, this one works great!!  I am so very happy with it!",8/9/2010

The problem with this upper bottle warmer is that it takes eternity to warm a bottle from the fridge. How long, you ask, is eternity? with a hungry crying baby, 14 minutes (the product manual places the warm up time at 14 minutes)<br /><br />So, you may want to dispense hot water to the bottle to mix with dry formula. This is a lot faster than the bottle warm time but, according to my thermometer, the water dispensed was not even close to the termperature advertized in the manual.<br /><br />I got this because I thought that the warmer could be used to heat larger food containers like the sage spoonfuls. The problem I found was that the bottom of the warmer is uneven and so if the glass jars don't weigh enough they float around in the minimum water level and may get ucky water in them. Anyway, I found that the dr brown steam heater fits the sage spoonfuls glass jars perfectly (in a fraction of the time) and I've never had trouble with breakage.<br />I wanted to love this but it just doesn't do anything well.

Features that would be oh-so-nice to have: a belt clip!  You end up carrying these things around a lot and the talk button placement means you may end up accidentally activating the intercom function if you stuff it in your pocket.

The first one we returned less than a month after purchase because we couldn't resolve the interference from other products in our home.  On the advice of a friend, we went to Target and bought a much cheaper version that still had the pan/zoom feature.  That one was wonderful, until it stopped charging.

Our son developed reflux at about 6 weeks and could not sleep flat on his bassinet anymore so we decided to get this one. We loved it! At first we would only put him in for naps but then we decided to take it upstairs and have him sleep on it since he needed to be at a inclined position. He slept in the swing every night from the time he was about 8 weeks old until 5 months! Sometimes when he was fussy we would turn on the swing and he would love to watch the mobile move and the rocking motion. He would typically fall asleep within 10 minutes. This was also helpful when he would poop in the middle of the night and I would change him because he would stay up for an hour unless I put the swing on and then it would only take him about 10-15 minutes to go back to sleep. We never really used the music. The material is really comfortable and soft and easy to clean. This does take up a bit of space so you have to make sure you have room for it.,4/12/2015

We have a Kia Sorento and the back seat (bench) does not sit level to the ground so we were having issues getting a car seat to be rear-facing without having it rigged too much. We even googled &#34;car seats to fit Kia Sorento&#34; because we were having so much difficulty.  The Evenflo fits perfectly!  We have a small hand towel underneath it but it tightens so much that there is no wriggle room at all.  I love the easy-latch system as well -- it's so easy to move it between cars!<br /><br />I will comment that when rear-facing, it must be tilted all the way back.  This then makes the front stick out quite a bit - which was ok for our car because our back seats recline, but I think if the back seat didn't recline, it would take up a lot more room (front seat would have to be further up).<br /><br />Overall we are very happy with the seat and would definitely buy it again.",5/20/2013

It was too big for my daughter to sit in it comfortable. It is difficult to put on by yourself with a newborn child. The strapes are very long which the pictures don't show. I wish instead of wasting $30 on this carrier I would have just invested more in a nicer one. My daughter is almost 2 months old now and it still doesn't work for us.",6/19/2013

At the time, it was the only tub that held the baby in place while you washed them. I quickly found the headrest to be useless, as it doesn't stay in place, and bunches up the sling, so that my son would tip from side to side like a hammock. Also, there's not enough room at the end of the sling to get your hand in there to rinse the washcloth, or fill a cup to rinse your baby (especially once your baby get a little bigger and their feet hang over the end of the sling.) It does make it easy to rinse your baby, and my son seemed pretty comfortable in it. He has never complained about taking a bath in it. Once he started to sit up on his own, we just started giving his baths in the big tub with a foam cushion to keep him from slipping. It wasn't worth the hassle of trying to get the foam pad in the botom to dry out, it was always cold and a little slimy (from soap that didn't rinse out), and my son didn't really like sitting in the tub without the sling unless the pad was completely dry (which sometimes took a few days). It served us well, and proved very durable (never leaked or cracked, the sling held up to our son who was almost 10 pounds at birth), but a little inconvenient. I'll think I'll shop around a little for our next baby.",3/14/2002

(and still attractive!),"I am super picky and have been looking for a diaper bag for a while. My wishlist: a small front flap messenger style bag with outside storage compartments for quick accesibility to my things (keys, credit cards... etc) as well as baby's. I also didnt want it to look like a diaper bag, but i didnt want it to look like a purse either. I wanted a bag that simplified outings with the baby, not made them more difficult.<br /><br />I went around and around considering this bag, but originally decided against it and ordered one of those 1/2 price bundle types with a changing pad, bottle bag...<br /><br />When it came I was so disappointed with the quality, and it was just *too much* to be bothered with. I quickly returned it, bit the bullet and ordered this bag. I wish I would have ordered it to begin with! This is definitely a quality product and worth the price. I will explain as much as I can since there are no alternate photo views if the product. Hopefully I can later add pictures.<br /><br />First off- It's smaller than the pictures make it seem (which was a plus for me) so definitely read the measurements and pull out your ruler to really get an idea of it's size. You will be pleasantly surprised or disappointed.<br /><br />I haven't started using this yet but I packed it in preparation for the hospital. It fits 12 nb diapers stacked and slid in vertically in its front to back width. In about the same space filling in the bag I can also fit four onsies, a pair of pants and two footed pj's all nb size. Good to note: once the flap is pulled open there is no zipper that closes the bag, but i really like this feature. I really like the idea of being able to just stick my hand right in the bag. The interior has two open mesh pockets along the back side. I stuck a pair of nb monkey slippers in one, and a baby comb/brush in the other, but more smaller items could fit as well.<br /><br />Another great feature is the expandable compartment in the front of the bag. When you lift the front main flap there is a small zippered pocket on the face of the bag. The pocket fully zips open (like a drawbridge in front of a castle). The flap has a zippered mesh pocket and the actual compartment extends into the interior of the bag. This is nice because you can have something &#34;under&#34; the items in the bag, but still accessible without rummaging through the bag to get to it, and without making a huge bulge in the front of the bag. I can fit an 80 count soft pack of bum boosa wipes in it, and later it will be the perfect hiding spot for dirty cloth diaper inserts. Stacked in front of the wipes i have four folded flannel wipes/burp cloths. When i zip the flap closed it looks like nothing is in it at all.<br /><br />The back of the bag has a open pocket the width of the bag, which i imagine will be great for a change pad/thin folded blanket. I love that there are pockets on each side of the bag, but one has a flap closure and one doesnt. This means i can choose the accesibility. I prefer to have my cell phone in the unflapped pocket so i can just grab it, while my husband would probably choose to put his in the flapped pocket. It seems simple, but i think its part of what makes this bag so useful.<br /><br />Finally the front main flap that closes that bag has a zippered pocket sort of hidden and incoorprated into the flap. It's the entire size of the flap. Inside it has a small zippered pocket the perfect size for credit cards. The main flap closes by magnet which I first thought I wouldn't like because I wouldnt be able to stuff the bag full, but thats actually why I do. If you pack the bag and dont overstuff, the magnet is great at holding the bag closed and looking neat. This keeps me from wanting to overload the bag which is the whole point of the bag. Grab-n-go, no excess, just you need. I would compare the fabric of the bag to that of an umbrella, but not cheap looking. I love this because this means its waterproof and really easy to wipeclean. The strap has a d-ring that's supposed to make it easy to attach to a stroller, but i havent tried this. Just eyeballing it the strap has about an 18 in. drop but can easily be shortened to about half that size or fully extended to double and would fit across the body.<br /><br />I ordered the blush and it is true to the color my monitor shows although i would call it more rosey pink than blush. Its not exactly a soft color, but isnt overwhelming. Its warm and feminine.<br /><br />I love this bag! It's simplicity is well thought out and designed. Its a quality bag I can see standing the test of time (and dirt and stains). I plan on doing a lot of baby wearing and can already imagine grabbing up this bag and my keys and hitting the streets with my little one with everything I need. No bulk, no fuss, no frills.",3/18/2013

The heart shape is cute but sometimes they shift in my bra and are not in the right place to help protecting against leaks because the shape is irregular. The shape allows the pads to lay flat and eliminates the seam that your average round pads have. This allows it to be more discrete under your bra. In my opinion, that's a fair trade off.

I didn't use a separate bassinet for my first child and tried to use the large, shelf-like bassinet in the pack & play we received but hated how it wasn't completely flat. I chose this one because it looks much more modern than 95% of bassinets out there (I am not a fan of all the lace). The bassinet was very easy to assemble, seems very sturdy, and I LOVE how I can carry it around the house!<br /><br />The pack & play was a little more challenging to assemble, but the directions were pretty good and I got everything assembled in under an hour. I wish all of the pack & play accessories fit in the bag provided (I couldn't fit the changing table components in the bag). Overall, this is a nicer pack & play than the original one I had and all of the components that fit on top ( storage, changing table, bassinet) are nice features.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this now for over a week and have a few additional comments. The most negative aspect of the bassinet I that the pad is under the removable liner. While the liner is soft and removable ( making washing totally possible) there is not a way to replace with a clean sheet in the middle of the night if the baby spits up, etc. I wish it was designed to accommodate a bassinet sheet rather than having to wash the whole liner. Other than this, I am loving the bassinet! It is sitting two feet from my bed and I love how I can hear my baby breathing having him so close to me!

Awesome product and some Answers to a few user issues :-),"We absolutely LOVE these. I have 6 kids and have used them consistently. Right now I have a 2 1/2 y/o (lol yes we are potty training but with a new sibling you know how that is going!) and a 4 month old so these are great. They are perfect sized for a BIG mess or for 2-4 smaller messes and with the tie handles you can close and open as needed. Also we use them for messed clothes whether it be from diaper explosions or just down right dirty. We even use them for older kids clothes (shirts, socks, undies, bathing suits...a pair of my older kids pants wouldn't fit but the rest does, and I'm talking older like 10, 11 and 17!) These are great for sooo many things I don't have the time or space to list them all and for every one I can tell you I'm sure someone else can think of 5 more :-)<br /><br /> So I'm going to give a few of you a very simple and logical answers to a two of your problems<br />1) The smell is too strong.<br />  Ok. So I can't completely disagree with this BUT of course when something is scented and is contained the smell is going to be stronger when you first open it and keep it in the same packaging. I have a quart sized Ziploc type bag in the diaper bag and that makes them portable and the smell isn't as strong but still you smell the scent not the poop (WHICH just a IMO, these work so great and even when the scent is really faded I would still rate these better then the others I have tried because they really keep the scent in and the scent of the bag I think is more for parents to think it makes it work better)<br /><br /> Also for those of us that use them at home I put the in a used wipes box and feed them through this helps lessen the smell AND bring me two the 2nd problem some people have had trouble with<br />2) The are hard to use (get out of box)<br />  So I have a solution for this... when I get a new box I open it completely and then separate it in thirds. Don't separate the bags  just put them in a empty pop up wipes box then carefully feed one through the pop up area and then gently pull up and use, the others will follow as long as you don't yank them out too hard or pull too fast. Easy, simple and you are re-purposing something :-)",11/18/2013

We were immediately surprised that the potty seat was very loose fitting in all of the toilets in our house.  Not knowing better, we assumed that this was as good as it got with potty seats.    Our daughter had been using it for a couple months when disaster struck.  She was happily singing on the potty and kind of wiggling from side to side to the song when the potty slipped and actually fell right into the toilet with her on top of it.    Luckily, my wife was right there, but it was very scary for all involved.  I definitely do not recommend traumatizing your child when you are trying to teach him or her the \\""goodness of the potty\\"".    Ultimately we did what we should have done in the first place, and we looked at the reviews of the various potty seats on Amazon.  If only we had known that this one has a less than stellar reputation.  We ended up with the Baby Bjorn potty seat (also available on Amazon), which has a dial that adjusts the snugness of the fit, and it can be easily customized to the size of any seat you might run into.  It costs a lot more, but it is worth every penny.    So, if you have the typical oval (elongated) toilet seat, stay away from this one.

Whatever.    Let me give you my context for reviewing: I wanted a stroller that could comfortably do two dog walks a day; corner well, absorbs bumps well, and yes, even jog at points (altho this particular model isn't necessarily recommended for that). I waited somewhat impatiently to use this stroller, as I purchased it before my son was born but the car seat adapter in diamond was not available, so I have been using the crappy Graco snap-frame stroller until about 4 weeks ago when he had enough head stability to ride in this. (Lack of availability of parts - disappointment #1).    This stroller feels great. Rides like a Cadillac, and it does exactly what I wanted it to do (above). My downsides, and why I only gave it three stars:    1. The location of the brake... on the right hand side of handlebar. Not the most logical spot. At least if they are going to place it here, they should also have some sort of brake at the foot.  Even my Graco snap-in gave me that. Instead, the handle bar height adjuster sits in the center of the bar, where you would instinctively think a brake would be. For the first week I pulled on that, thinking it was the brake. Not very smart layout - my hubby used it a couple of times and said the same thing, and I'd never discussed it with him. Plus, he is left-handed, so it was even more \\""unnatural,\\"" so to speak.  This stroller needs a hand brake, or a foot brake, or both.     2. For $500 you should get at least a handle bar tray, or a cup holder, or something. Again, even my Graco gave me a tray with my snap-in. They should offer your choice of one of their accessories for that kind of money. I'm not cheap but this just seems like gouging to me.     3. The canopy flap is a nice idea but poorly engineered. The magnet isn't strong enough to keep it there, so any breeze will blow it over,and if you have it open you have to pull the canopy back a bit to have some metal for the magnet to attach to. Velcro would be better.     4. For the money and all the hype about its versatility, I'd like to see this stroller be dual front and rear facing. The way the seat unit latches into the frame it could be done.     5. Color selection. Red, black, white, or purple?? I reluctantly chose the white because I didn't want my kid to bake in a dark stroller.  Good news is, the white, as another poster mentioned, is actually more \\""buff\\"" color and very nice. Perhaps they should re-name it or put out more neutral/earth tones?

Use suction from your mouth to clear your baby's nose? It might seem strange, but it is the most effective nose-clearing device on the market! This has been an absolute God-send! My 15-month old would totally flip out when he saw me coming at him with the bulb aspirator, and it never really worked anyway. I had a few rough nights recently when he was having trouble breathing through his nose due to a cold. I tried everything and nothing was helping, and I ordered this. What an amazing product! My son actually liked using it (I think he thought it was funny), and I was able to clear a lot of secretions from his nose in a very gentle non-traumatic fashion! (Don't worry, those secretions don't end up anywhere near your mouth.) I actually washed the filter in antibacterial soap and air-dried it, and I got several uses out of it. The 20 filters that they provide will last a long time if you do this, and I believe it is hygienic to do so if done in the right way (wash the whole device as well as the filter in hot water with antibacterial soap, air-dry, and don't put back together until completely dry).

The brush and sponge are too large for a baby bottle. It is very surprising because I am a huge fan of Dr. Brown's bottles and its other cleaning tools, but this is illogical. The sponge does not fit the nipple, the other tool for the nipple does not clean it and the brush is so big you get soap all over the kitchen when it goes in or out of the bottle.

We have been using these for almost a year and they have been a decent purchase. Just a few things to take note of when looking for a snack cup.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- sturdy plastic that is easily grabbed by little hands<br />- lids and cups are easy to clean or put into the dishwasher<br />- holds a decent amount of preferred snack<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Snacks become dry if left too long<br />- If you are pulling food out, you can also lose food in the process<br /><br />The biggest con for me is losing snacks while trying to grab them. In the process my little one will get upset that she is starting to see food fall from her grasp. It bothers her a lot when it happens while in a shopping cart where the food falls to the floor. As she has been getting bigger and her hands are getting bigger more food has fallen and it is annoying to her. They also get stale a lot quicker than if they had a lid to them.<br /><br />I like these, and I think they are great for keeping the food all in one place but I think a future purchase I might go with a different snack cup.	2014-05-18

I guess because when they forward face, in the event of an accident, the force wil be applied to the thigh bone (a strong, big bone) rather than to the hips or internal organs. Also, we got raised the head rest up a bit and got the seat at a good angle (somewhere between the two lines). Now I absolutely love this seat. Im so happy we didn't return it!<br /><br />Original review: I bought the guide 65 sport. I thought I was going to love it. I shopped for months for it. It's inexpensive and compact. Even better is the padding. It's got a memory foam feel to it. It's the best one I've found as far as padding goes. We installed it rear facing using the seatbelt and a locking clip as my van doesn't have the LATCH system. We used a rolled up towell as directed to get the proper recline angle. My son is 10 months and 22 lbs so we used the more upright recline mark.<br /><br />But here are the problems. The seatbelt (or latch belt) is to be threaded under the padding and in front of the crotch buckle. Therefore you can only use the most inner or the middle crotch buckle slot. We used the middle one. Well the seatbelt encroaches on the crotch belt which pulls the crotch belt down so the farthest I can pull that buckle up is as high as if I'd used the most inner slot and had my son sit on part of it. In other words the buckle is right at his crotch. So that makes the straps that should come over his hips end up coming over his thighs.<br />The other issue is the head rest. Even reclined his head is being pushed forward. The crotch buckle problem would resolve once he became forward facing. But the head rest problem I believe would be worse forward facing because the seat back would be more upright.<br /><br />Other than that it's a really good seat. I'm so disappointed. Because even though the seat is compact it's roomy. And oh so squishy.<br /><br />I'll be returning itand starting my seat hunt all over again.	2014-05-18

But there are 2 big flaws in the design of the frame: 1) As others have noted, the storage under the stoller is hard to get to.  Generally, as you are already loaded down with the stroller/baby bag etc, you need easy access storage.  Basically, you can't put larger things under there without having to lift out the carseat, which is a huge pain.  It would have been simple for them to put a bigger opening or a zip opening but for some reason they've designed very poor access.  Also, it's really hard to get the storage fabric detached to clean, so if anything spills, good luck! 2) For those of us who don't have unlimited storage at home and need to prop the folded frame in the hallway, it props poorly and is always falling over.",7/26/2013

I have used mesh and found them to get dirty and stay dirty quickly but my babies loved/love feeding themselves. I also love the idea of putting whatever I am eating in there for them to enjoy without worrying about choking or having to spend hours of my meals cutting everything up. Anyways these were not like using mesh at all. Sure they clean up great but my daughter has a rough time getting food through the holes. Also they don't hold much food and considering all she can do is pretty much suck the juices from the food I am constantly dumping and refilling them. They are best for purees only and considering the price I cannot recommend them for replacing a mesh feeder. I have not tried them with frozen food yet but I think these would work nicely for the teething babies.<br />On a positive note, they travel well and seem to hold up well in the top rack of the dishwasher.

I have three other covers that are the apron-style, that I no longer use because I like this so much better.  There were several times when I didn't have a mothers room to get to, and had to breastfeed in a coffee shop or someplace, and sometimes I couldn't find a corner to sit in.  I hated that as the aprons, while fairly big (and I'm small at 5'1\\""), just can't cover me adequately, even without a baby wiggling around there. Plus I always needed to wear a maternity tank as my sides and back were exposed -- if I didn't my skin would be showing and I wasn't a big fan of that.<br /><br />This cover is awesome.  I don't need to wear a maternity tank, I can just wear whatever I want, as my back and sides are completely covered. This cover makes a complete circle around you.  And most importantly, when my baby thrashes around he isn't flinging the cover everywhere and potentially exposing me.  It's great peace of mind and one less thing to worry about which I'm grateful for.<br /><br />Additional pros are the neckline is pretty good sized, I can see baby well enough without it being too big. The fabric is also nice and thick and I love the tangerine print a lot.<br /><br />There are a few cons. The pillow isn't that helpful for me. It helps a bit, but it's not thick enough to get my baby to the right height without lifting my legs up higher. It also is attached to the front of the cover in a bit of an awkward way - to use it, I have to put the pillow on my lap, put baby on top, then flip the cover over me.  Hard to describe but realize the pillow IS attached so if you want to use it, you'll have a bit of jiggering to deal with.  Not a dealbreaker for me by any means.<br /><br />The other con is that it is big because of the pillow -- so takes up quite a bit of room in the diaper bag.  I have a tote bag for a purse and it fits in there, but there are times when I just want to take the pillow out (it is removable) so it takes up less space.<br /><br />Overall, lifesaver with a few cons I can live with.",8/6/2012

It's true that the basket is mostly inaccessible while the seat is reclined, but that hasn't been too great of a problem for us.  It accomodates our diaper bag nicely, and we just position it so that the most crucial items are easily reached without disturbing the resting baby too much.<br />I really like the one-hand collapse function on this stroller.

We are pleased with the stroller except for the fact that the front seat will not stay in the upright position.  Since we were past the 30 day period for return to Amazon and had discarded the box the stroller had been sent in we are evidently out of luck.  For almost three months we have been trying to get through to the Breckenridge Company who only seem to have part time people working to solve problems.  They have no suggestions other than sending the entire stroller back to them (we had discarded the box) which will take probably many weeks instead of sending a new one in exchange for the malfunctioning one.  They also said they would send a mailing label which has not been received.  We are very disappointed.  They certainly do not seem to stand behind their product!!

Recommended for 5 months and older,"This is a cute, simple, small toy that consists of rattling beads, a spinner with small balls in it and a button that plays one of five short songs when pressed. The button may look like a colorful set of \\""white\\"" piano keys, but the keys don't operate independently of one another. The \\""black\\"" keys light up when music plays. It has no volume control or other selector buttons. It's probably about 4 inches wide by 5 inches tall.<br /><br />I bought this toy for my daughter before she was born. I showed it to her periodically, but I don't think she was really interested until about 5 months. At the time it functioned more as a rattle for her than anything else. That changed at 6 or 7 months when she learned that she could push the music button herself. She wasn't very coordinated, of course, but when she would kick it with a foot or jam it with her hand, she would then repeat the behavior several times after she heard the music. I felt happy for her that she could see a toy respond to her movements and that she could feel a sense of control (or whatever a baby feels). Now at 8 months old, she understands what pushing the button will do and will often seek out the toy to play with it intentionally.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this toy. It doesn't keep my 8 month old daughter occupied all the time, but what toy would?? When she does use it, she is happy. It seems to be well-made, easy to use, and resistant to gumming and saliva. I would recommend it to others.",3/28/2012

The construction and organization of that bag is impressive, and I'm generally a Skip Hop fan.<br />I thought I would love this diaper bag, and I really wanted to. I was very excited about ordering it. But after using it for a few months, I think it's just okay. It's not as big as I thought it would be. I pack for a 3 y/o who's just barely potty-trained and an infant. I've found that once the mesh pockets on the inside of the main compartment have been filled, there's very little room for anything else in the main compartment. I do like the length of the handles (fit on the shoulder nicely) and I do like that it's a bag that both my husband and I can use (he won't carry anything he deems to be too girlie, which is basically anything that's not black and/or gray). Because there's no padding on the longer (adjustable) shoulder-strap (that allows you to wear the bag messenger-style), using that strap can get pretty uncomfortable very quick. I do think that the size of the bottle compartments (on the outside of the bag) are great-sized and capable of fitting a large water bottle; certainly any size of baby bottle or sippy cup (without handles). I don't like that there isn't any clear-cut area for the parent's things (wallet, keys, sunglasses, phone, etc.). Good thing I only buy cheap sunglasses, because they end up getting thrown on top of the main compartment with all of the other miscellaneous things that get thrown there (that don't quite fit actually inside the bag). It also pretty much never stands up straight on its own -- you must lean it against something so it doesn't tip over (and spill all the stuff that's setting rather precariously on top). The materials feel sturdy and I do think this bag would hold up to extensive/extended use.<br />Because this bag hasn't lived up to my expectations, I'm currently eyeing the Ju Ju Be Be Prepared. It looks like that one is slightly bigger and better organized. If you're looking for a gigantic diaper bag like me, the Skip Hop Bento might not be the one for you.",7/25/2012

We had originally bought the Eddie Bauer Classic Wooden Swing only to bring it back.  It was the worst swing ever.  The settings were way to high for an infant.

She loves the mobile and cannot stop staring at it and smiling at it.  She is in awe of it.

It worked OK while we still had the sling in it but I have a large son (98% percentile) so he outgrew it very quickly.  The plastic bump in the middle was very inconveniently placed and made bath time difficult for me and uncomfortable for my son.  I order this tub to replace it and with I had gotten this tub first!  It is very versatile and you can use it as a tub or flip it over to use as a sling.  He can lay on his tummy while it's in the sling position making it very easy to actually wash him without having to hold him up with both arms.  He can't sit up by himself yet but the walls are tall enough that he can prop himself up against them, or he can lounge and use the edges as a sort of pillow.  After bath time is over this hangs with a very sturdy hook to dry.  I have been using it 3-4 times a week for just about a month now and have had no problems at all with it getting a musty odor as others have mentioned.  I find that it actually dries fairly quickly.  My only complaint is the sides could have just a little more beads in them so it is not so floppy if the tub isn't filled all the way.  Others have also complained about having to fill the whole tub in order to use this which it true.  It is fabric and will not hold water on it's own but I don't find that to be a problem.  It fills almost the whole tub anyways and I use the extra tub space to float toys for my son to reach for while on his tummy when it's flipped over to be more of a sling/lounge.

Unfortunately, it comes apart easily.  We decided to convert our two year old's crib into a toddler bed since he learned how to climb out of it. We ordered this item based on all the positive reviews.  We found that it did assemble fairly easily; however, when it came time to put our wiggle worm to bed the adjustable bars that fit under the mattress are not secure enough to keep the safety rail in place. The adjustable bars are \\""locked\\"" into place by a small silver button that pops up securing the bars into place.  The problem with this is that these buttons are facing upwards under the mattress. So when our son starts to squirm his way off the bed, the buttons are pushed and the rail slips off. At first, I thought that I had not secured the bars correctly. After three attempts at locking the bars into place, we realized that the item is just flawed.  It does not take much for our son to unlock these bars just by wiggling and squirming on the bed.  I feel that this is a HUGE safety concern since it would not be hard for him the to get an arm, leg, or even his head stuck between the rail and the edge of mattress.

It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another.  I cannot comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze.  The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner isn't fully expanded.  We measure in a different container and pour into the liner.  The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just don't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean.

It is definitely bulky, but our 16-month-old can't open the door, and our guests can still easily exit the basement.  Good product.    ***UPDATE***  Our son was able to open this lock the week after he turned two.

Both are easy to throw together in an evening. Both have very solid construction, keeping the particle board and other cheep parts to a minimum (surprising for furniture at this price point). The design is tasteful; it's not really modern, but it's not classic like the majority of the tacky, ugly, tasteless nursery furniture to be found out there.    We bought this and the crib for our daughter's room and passed on the rest of the set. The dark wood and white paint looks great with a light color paint on the walls, and the understated design compliments both the Ikea furniture and the second-hand stuff we used to round out the room. The drawers in the changing table are enough for all of her clothes, diapers, and other random stuff. The crib has drawers, too, so you shouldn't need anything else until you kid gets big enough for toys and books.    Add some custom knobs from Anthropologie or an antiques store and you're set!    (By the way, the top rail holds a Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad well, and after she's done with that we'll store her stuffed animals there.)",12/14/2010

If you are lucky enough to be nursing several times through the night as I do, you'll quickly learn to abhor these rigid walls. I found this especially true as my baby falls asleep during nursing but tends to wake up when I lift him back into the Snuggle Nest.

Once I received it and realized it was only one I then looked at the title and see that it ends with the word &#34;Black.&#34;  It should be more clear that this is only for one and not for six, like pictured.<br />2) The Price...this is a $0.05 part, which is why I thought this price was for six of them.  But Nalgene seems to be only one making and selling these for the Nalgene bottle so if you want one, you will have to pay.<br /><br />Personally, I can't quite figure out why so many people like the wide-mouth bottles.  They are very expensive and unless you want to wear your drink you will need one of these in addition to the bottle.  That's something like $15 for a water bottle.  I do understand that the wide-mouth bottles are easier to clean but I only put water in my bottles so that feature is lost on me.  I also recognize that you can fit ice cubes into the wide-mouth bottles...but I don't like cold water and when I do, I simply fill the bottom inch of my water bottle with water and then freeze it.<br /><br />Prior to a long trip I recently purchased both a new wide-mouth (with this sipper cap) and several of Nalgene's old style white thin-necked blue-capped 32 oz. bottles.  The old style bottles won out by a mile.  They are much easier to drink from while driving, walking, hiking, etc. than the wide-mouth bottles.  They also are made from a softer plastic which I like more.  Someone mentioned that there is difference in materials between these two that could have health consequences but 1) most of the super bad crap that used to be in plastic reusable bottles has been banned and 2) I'm not leaving water in these long enough for it to matter.",10/30/2014

I have a 9 month old and have only tried these 2 strollers, so I can only compare the Combi to the Graco.  Since the Graco was neither Metro (to wide and bulky for shopping) nor Lite (that stroller was HEAVY and barely fit in my minivan), I was looking for something that was compact, light and fun.  The Combi is all those things, but at the expense of the features I liked in the Graco: adult cup holders, large basket, adjustable handle, adult foot bar for getting up curbs.)<br /><br />That being said, it is a wonderful stroller.  My son is almost meditative in this stroller!  He just sits back and watches the scenery, now that he can actually see it.  The Graco was so bulky that he had to lean to see around the edges.  And I had to lean to see him even if the canopy was folded because it stuck up so high.  The canopy on this isn't very adequate if you need good sun protection for long walks, but that is easily fixed with a separate sunshade.  (I bought the one by Protect-a-bum and it fits great.)  I find this stroller far easier to use on grass than the Graco, probably because it is so much lighter.<br /><br />The basket underneath is basically a joke.  It starts out small, then it has the support bar going through the middle, making it even smaller.  You might fit a few diapers, but not a diaper bag.  In the Graco I fit tons of stuff, like my purse and diaper bag and shopping bags.  The support bar isn't situated back far enough to allow you to step on it so you can get the leverage to get the stroller up a curb.  The instructions say to turn around and pull the stroller up, but it is annoying to not have the option to do it both ways.<br /><br />I love the carry strap.  It is so convenient to sling this over my shoulder and carry my son down the steps instead of having to carry one or the other.  It is a bit awkward that the guard rail is soft, making it difficult to grab the front of the stroller when going up or down a few steps.<br /><br />Overall, I have been very pleased with this stroller for the 2 weeks I've had it.  My 9 month old really enjoys strolling around in it and I find it much easier to stroll him in.on it so you can get the leverage to get the stroller up a curb.

He is a bit young but when the snow melts, he'll be old enough to use it outside. For now, he sits on the floor and rolls it like a car. He also loves to pull the tail and pat its head. Just doing that, he has given his Wheely a lot more use than most of his electronic toys.  The first thing I noticed is how sturdy this thing is. I feel like I could sit on it and it won't break. The price tag is steep but you can't get this kind of quality from plastic toys. It -will- last you several years, even with a rough kid. It's also super cute and very appealing visually with its simple design.  I had the idea in my head that the child is supposed to have their legs bent a little in order to scoot it around. I think a normally sized 2 year old would fit this just fine and you wouldn't need the larger one. My son is in the 90th percentile in height and he can barely touch the floor on the small- He can't scoot it even if he tried.",12/9/2011

Unfortunately, we almost immediately found this to be one of the worst products we have purchased for our child.      The biggest problem is that this leak-proof cup leaks.  The cap is so terribly over-designed that taking it apart and putting it back together properly is a chore. Four different pieces (the outer blue shell, the yellow mouthpiece insert, and a 2-piece form-fitting silicone and plastic valve contraption) must be separated, each individually cleaned and then reassembled. This might be simple enough if it actually worked, but when putting the lid back together the yellow and blue pieces simply do not realign properly. What this means is that the spout may be leak-proof but the cap itself isn't.  We've followed the instructions implicitly and repeatedly end up with the contents spilling out of the top.    In addition, if your child likes to chew, this spout seems to be too thin,  soft and flexible to be durable.  Normally we'd think this might end up being a choking hazard, but since we won't use the cup because of the leakage we really don't know how durable it actually is.    And then there's the price.  This Foogo costs approximately 2-3 times that of any other sippy cup we've purchased previously, and the cheaper ones don't leak and are simple to clean.  Yes, this one may be insulated, but if you're in doubt spend the extra money you'll save on a small cooler bag.    Most disturbing is that I voiced these concerns to Thermos directly via it's website a few weeks ago.  To date I've yet to receive the courtesy of a reply.      Steer clear of Foogo.  It's not worth the bother, the leaks, the price, or Thermos' poor customer service.",9/10/2007

It does make it a tad difficult to get the TP off to use if your dispenser is in a strange location (ours is on the same wall as the back of the toilet, so you have to turn around as it is to get it).

I leave the clear air tubes attached to the pump at all times; I just pop them off the valves, coil both together, then stuff them in a ziplock bag next to the pump. I have a breadbox sized Tupperware to hold the sterilized bottles and valve parts, then I dump the parts back in after using.

I recently had my 4th child. Over the years, I have owned Gracos, Emmajungas, Maclarens and Evenflos. Most of them were junky, too bulky or alternatively too skimpy. Strollers are by their very nature a big piece of equipment. Expecting them to weigh next to nothing and still retain quality is a pipe dream. I am not the kind of person who is more concerned wtih status ( and in NY where I am from originally, this is THE stroller brand to have) than quality and function. I clip coupons and I watch for bargains all the time. I don't think you must spend a ton of money all the time to get quality. But in this case, IME it has been true that you get what you pay for.<br />With the exeption of the Maclaren (they make great strollers, but I wanted a travel system and they don't make one) this Peg Perego Pliko P3 is the best stroller out there! I have no problem opening and closing it, it turns on a dime, the seat lies pretty flat for newborns and young infants (when not being used with the carseat). Yeah, it's pricey and I understand that not everyone can afford it. But I have spent too much $$ over the years on several bad strollers to know that for me, it was worth it to spend the money. It's gorgeous to boot (I have the black and grey one, it looks beautiful and not too cutesy or IMO tacky like sooo many of the other strollers out there). I do wish the basket were a bit more accessable, but it hasn't been terrible. <br />Don't let the other reviews fool you- this stoller is worth the money IME and I'm really glad I have it.",2/10/2004

I was hesitant to stay with Summer Infant after having 3 different \\""dud\\"" monitors from them in such a short time span but they have great customer service and the Baby Touch got good reviews.  Anyways, compared to the Slim & Secure the picture quality is worse.  I expected it to be better since the Baby Touch is newer and more expensive than the Slim & Secure.  It's not that big of a deal though because as other reviewers have said, you cant expect high def quality from a baby monitor.  Another thing that bothers me with this monitor is the constant humming/feedback from the parent unit.  We use a sound machine in my daughter's room and with the Slim & Secure we could always hear the sound machine through her monitor...it was quite peaceful!  With the Baby Touch all you hear is a humming noise...it doesn't even pick up the noise from the sound machine.  It's honestly really annoying but not enough for me to bother with customer service for the 4th time.  The last problem I have with this unit is that the belt clip is upside down.  Maybe mine is defective, I'm not sure...but I can't use the kick stand/belt clip because it would be resting on the top where the buttons (video, talk, and volume buttons) are.  So any time I carry the unit around it has to just lay flat or I have to carry the dock around with me too, which is annoying.  The fact that no one else has commented on this issue makes me think my unit might be defective....AGAIN.  Overall I'm just not impressed with this monitor and I'm glad I received it as an upgrade instead of paying full price for it.",1/30/2012

The doorknob we have on said door is apparently on the smaller side as there's still space inside for a slightly larger knob. We're still able to use this though. Basically you squeeze each side and turn to open as normal. The center grey piece can open to expose the lock (if there is one), but ours got pushed in and I haven't bothered to try and get it back out as we never lock the bedroom door.

YES!<br /><br />I searched high and low for a monitor that would fulfill all the wants and needs my husband and I wanted in a baby monitor.  We thought about going the route of no separate handheld monitor unit and just getting a wi-fi based camera and use our phones.  But I didn't want to rely 100% on the battery life of my phone plus I wanted the versatility of having something for a sitter without having to share a password with them.  I also really wanted the opportunity for my husband to check in on baby while at work or while a sitter was at the house.  So this monitor fit the bill for all things needed/wanted as well as being a highly recommended brand name.  So even though I could have purchased a much cheaper option, I splurged for this one.  And I am glad I did!<br /><br />We haven't used all of the features yet but it works like a charm so far.  We've only had it set up for about a week to test it out before our little one arrives.  My husband has the app set up on his phone and gets notified when there are movements and sounds detected in the nursery (and has been working quite well as a doggie cam so far!).  I've been at home when he's logged into the camera and panned/tilted/zoomed it all around and tested out the music and talk back features (which he startled me with by yelling &#34;hey what are you doing?&#34; randomly while I was in the nursery putting things away HA!).  The handheld unit has a super large display so it's easy to see everything.  The night vision seems to be pretty good as well.  For everything we've used it for so far it seems great!  I can't wait to get an additional camera, once they are available, to add to the system for additional room coverage/doggie cam/home security.<br /><br />So overall I would recommend this monitor for some one who is looking for all the bells and whistles on a monitor.

The gate fits its purpose and is easy to manipulate while holding a child or laundry.  Our only complaint was the installation.  I had read on other reviews that it was hard to install and I agree.  We installed it 3 times, first with screws it came with (it stayed up 30 minutes) and second with slighty longer screws and anchors (this lasted 1 day until we swung the door open and our daughter leaned on it and pulled it right out of the wall).  Finally we got long screws and made sure we hit a stud, now we are good to go!    My son loves his freedom and I love the work I am getting done while he has it.",1/12/2008

The cover is easy to close and the handles make it easy for my 15-month-old to hold and carry.  It is definitely better than the other straw cup that we have, as that one leaves at least 2 ounces of fluid on the bottom if you're holding it perfectly and nearly half of the liquid if the child even semi-tips it.  However, my biggest gripe is that it is extremely difficult to tell if you've screwed the top on correctly.  The grooves are very shallow/small so putting the lid on incorrectly is a very easy mistake to make and it is not noticeable at all.  It is only noticeable when the child shakes the container or flips it upside down and the liquid quickly spills everywhere.  I try to put the lid on very slowly, very carefully, and then shake it sideways to see if anything is coming out, and I still sometimes miss it when I've put the lid on crooked!  Luckily, I only give my daughter water so nothing has been stained or been a sticky mess.

The first couple times she was very scared of this, but has since got the hang of it. I also got the Kalencom reusable Silicon put to go with this. The combo works very well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to set up. Easy to clean. I use the reusable silicon liner (in green). It does not stain and washes well with a bidet. Nothing sticks. Wipe with a toilet paper and then a disinfecting wipe after each use.<br />- One solution for all needs: training potty, floor potty, on the commode potty, travel potty. Also love the plastic bags for travel.<br />- The biggest plus for me was that this potty is pretty low, unlike a chair. The child (my 14 month old is on the taller side - 75th percentile) has to almost squat, which is great. Much healthier for their colons, and helps them eliminate completely instead of in rabbit pellets all through the day. (please do read up on the squatting position for elimination).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The hole is on the bigger side and if I don't pay attention, my baby's butt can hang pretty low inside. But thats not a big problem and can be managed.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this potty.",6/5/2014

I recommend getting it BEFORE you have your baby and if you're positive you'll be going back to work (because of the price). I used it 3 times a day after I went back to work and it's very efficient. It could pump up to twice as fast as my friend's pump; she was doing it at the same time with me at work.  It's easy to maintain since no air gets in the tube. The backpack is very nice because I had to carry a purse and huge tote bag of food into work everyday. I also liked the little black bottle carrier that will hold up to six 4-5oz bottles and the 3 ice packs it comes with. You'll want to buy more of the bottles or just by regular bottles that will fit right on it. I know that Dr. Browns worked and those cheap little 3pk Gerber bottles worked too. I'm sure it's going to last just fine for my next baby too.<br /><br />It's been about 13 months with this product and I still like it. I only use it about 2-3 times a week these days though.

I thought I would like Charlie Bananas best because you could get a more customizable fit since they are adjustable in the leg elastic. The Charlie Bananas fit the worst because all the bunching at the hip and the crossover snap turns out to be a pain in the butt. As my baby is getting bigger, they are fitting better but I thought they'd be the best for when he is smallest. Wrong. I've realized I prefer the snap rise adjustment because it is so much quicker and the snaps on the Rumparooz are the best. They just seem to \\""click\\"" right and easily. The double gussets are great at keeping in messes but my other diapers are able to do that too without them. The Rumparooz have a very high-quality feel to all the fabrics and the inserts. I also love the colors. My favorite diaper is the one I expected to like the least, the Bumgenius 4.0. I thought it would take forever to fit my newborn, but it fit as soon as the umbilical cord fell off and I started using our cloth diapers. Because the liner and the insert are both thin, the diaper is the most trim fitting and least bulky, especially at the hips. I wrongly assumed the thin fabric of the liner and the insert meant lower quality. Wrong again. I like some of the BG colors but wish they came in bolder, brighter colors and more prints. I would buy them up! Once I realized BG were my favorite of the diapers I had for my newborn, I went to a local baby boutique to buy some more. They didn't have any in colors I liked so I grabbed a few Moraki AI2s. These come with a hemp/cotton insert that doesn't feel soft to me and its a \\""one size\\"" insert so folding it over to fit a newborn creates bulk I don't like. I think its a user error and not a product defect, but I am having a hard time with leaks on those. I get major leakage in the leg openings. These were by far the most expensive of the diapers I've purchased and I keep thinking about returning them. I hesitate because they feel like they are very high quality and the colors and prints are super cute. Maybe I will get a better fit in a few weeks when baby is a little bit bigger.<br /><br />Verdict: I am only one month in to cloth diapering but if I could have known the pros and cons of each of the diapers I bought, I probably would have made my entire stash out of Bumgenius 4.0s. Most of the other diapers do the job well too but the Bumgenius diapers fit the best, hold the messes well, and they also cost the least. Win, win, win in my book.",2/18/2014

It had also been 7 years since I had my 2nd child, so I did the whole car seat research thing and ended up buying a Diono Radian RXT carseat on Amazon also. This is the carseat I used with this travel cart, I highly recommend both!<br /><br />This travel cart is very basic, easy to use, and not too expensive. I have used it on about 10 different travel trips with my son, who is now 16 months. If you are traveling by air and need to bring a carseat for whatever reason (i.e. you want to have it to use on the plane, you need it for a vehicle when you arrive at your destination, etc.) With the car seat attached to the travel cart you can either pull it behind you (just like luggage!) or push it in front of you, either way works. With the car seat attached, this cart is sturdy and does not tip over in any direction, with or without my child in it. I do not know if this is because the car seat I use is a steel frame (heavy!) car seat. Funny thing is, the car seat I use falls backward if I stand it up by itself without using the cart.<br /><br />I don't typically need to bring my big stroller on travel trips unless I need my son to be able to sleep in it (Disneyland trip we took when he was 3 months old). They are a real pain to travel with (going through airport security, breaking down appropriately to gate check, time consuming overall when traveling through busy airports). With the car seat attached to the travel cart, I wheel my kid from drop-off at the airport to airport security, I take him out of the seat, lower the travel cart handle and lay the car seat with the travel cart attached onto the xray belt and the whole thing fits through the xray machine (unless a friendly TSA agent offers to hand wand/check it, which you can also ask for), I walk through the security scanner then my son walks through the security scanner himself to me, I put him in his seat, get my shoes back on and collect my other items from the xray belt, and wheel him all the way onto the plane to our assigned row/seats. Some flight attendants will try to tell you that this is not going to fit down the aisle, just politely smile and explain that it will. I recommend wheeling your child behind you, that way you can lower travel cart handle, unlatch the car seat from the cart, the cart will automatically fold flat onto the floor, pick up the car seat with the kid in it, place in seat and buckle, pick up travel cart and place in your overhead storage compartment. This takes a lot of strength if your kid is a chunk like mine and/or if your car seat is heavy. I have received many compliments on how awesome this process is, and many people have asked me where I got my car seat/travel cart. I really like using the car seat on the plane because it lets my kid know that he has to stay in it, and he can sleep in it on the plane. Which is great for us because we live in Alaska and flights are long. This is also an awesome thing to have/use when switching planes! If you want to travel with your child under 2 on your lap but you need to bring your car seat to have at your destination, you can still use the travel cart to travel to go all the way to the plane and just gate check it with it attached and the handle lowered. A lot of times if this happens and the flights not full, they will let you bring it on the plane and use it, giving your infant a free seat. Another great thing about this travel cart is that when the handle is fully extended and attached to a car seat, you can sling a purse or a diaper bag on it just like a stroller.him in his seat, get my shoes back on and collect my other items from the xray belt, and wheel him all the way onto the plane to our assigned row/seats.

I didn't like the Symphony at all b/c the diaphragm that goes on the machine has to be really tight or it won't have good suction (which is most of the time).  I'm on my third PIS advanced.  With my first child, I had the PIS advanced backpack, first generation, and pumped for a year.  The amount of milk was adequate (had enough frozen away for extra month after I stopped).  I just didn't like the faceplate (I broke 3, where you attach the tubing to the faceplate), and the storage space for the backpack is very limited.  Then I bought the PIS advanced shoulder bag with my second child.  The storage area is better but the faceplate is still the same.  Then the PIS advanced limited edition came out.  I saw it and fell in love with it.  So I had to get it.  It's the nicest one thus far and long overdue.  The motor sits in a separate bag and the tubing can fit in the side pocket.  There is no danger of breaking the faceplate. I can just carry that to and from work.  I have two sets of parts, one for home and one at work). The bag has lots of storage space and best of all, it's chic.  They have blue, chocolate and black.  It also doubles as a diaper bag for me. <br /> <br />As for hands free pumping:  the only reason I was able to pump for a year fist time and now 11mo and still going is b/c of the hands free pumping kit.  You have to get the Medela softcup bras (they're comfy anyway) that supports handsfree pumping.  There are 2 tabs inside on the bottom and one latch on the top.  You don't need to buy the whole hands free pumping kit; you just need the loop and hook attachment (part #3007073).  That hooks onto the top of the bra where there is a latch.  Then you tie a rubber band (thicker kind from any office supply store) around the tabs (3 of them, two sewn in the bra and one from the loop and hook attachment).  Then you put the breastshield with connector with bottles attached on your breast.  Then you loop the rubber band separately around the connector (the part where you're suppose to attach the tubing).  Connect the tubing, Viola, it should stay there snugly.  You don't have to hold them anymore.  You can also use this method with the softfit breastshield.  If you have larger breasts, use bigger rubberbands or link two together.  Now you can massage to get more milk, eat lunch, type on the computer, whatever (just can't lie down).  You can buy adapter for avent system and pump directly into their bottles, or other brands.  And there is no need to pump every 3-4h after your milk supply is established... that's insane. In the first few weeks it may be necessary to establish supply. I pumped 4 times a day and was able to get min 30oz a day (I was bottle feeding breastmilk exclusively), then slowly decreased to 3, to 2 to 1 as my baby got older.  The key is to pump all the milk out (with massaging and squeezing your breast) and then let it run 1-2min longer.  Also, use the maximum suction you can tolerate (this will increase and plateau as you pump).  If you want to decrease supply, just pump shorter and longer period of time lapse in between pumping.  If you want to increase, pump longer and more frequently as well as drink more water/eat more.  I could increase and decrease my supply at will, even without breastfeeding.   <br /> <br />I pumped directly into 9 oz or 11 oz avent bottles using the avent adapter (avail at Babiesrus).  There are other systems out there.  I used the lansinoh milk storage bags to store my milk.  I store about 10-12oz (max 12oz) in each bag, squeeze all the air out, and deep freeze it for 6mo.  I know lansinoh suggest less than that, but it can be done as long as you get all the air out.  The trick is to use the side of a table, push the milk up to the ziplock and squeeze close the ziplock as the air is pushed out.  Since there are two zippers, a little milk can leak out of thefirst zipper to help get all the air out.  The bag will expand in the freezer just fine.  Once it's frozen, just don't nick the bag (b/c it's easy to damage it) and it will stay fine for 6mo in a deep freezer.  Even if you do damage the bag, it's ok.  it's just a pain when you thaw it. When you thaw the milk, you might see a little precipitate, but baby likes the milk just like it was fresh. <br /> <br />Happy pumping.",2/14/2007

We use the latch system, and it seems to get a little loose from time to time. My husband had to literally sit on the base with his knees while pulling the straps when installing it to get it secure enough (so it didn't move more than 1&#34; from side to side&#34;)<br /><br />My other concern was that it was a little too upright for a BRAND new newborn. When our son was 0-2 weeks, it felt like his head wasn't in the correct placement- his chin kept falling onto his chest. Not sure if this is a common concern with other carseats, I imagine it is. We showed the nurses his position before we left the hospital and they said he looked fine, but it really made me worry. After 2 weeks old, he didn't seem to &#34;crumple&#34; in the seat nearly as bad, and I felt much more comfortable with him in it.  I have seen other small babies in other carseats and they seem to be a little more reclined, which may have made me feel more secure those first weeks.<br /><br />Besides these two concerns, we've been very happy with the carrier and stroller since. The carrier is lighter than any of my friends with other car seat brands.  My son seems to be very comfy in it now and falls asleep easily in it.

We have started putting cardboard underneath to reduce the wear, but even with that there is still some damage.

This is a saddle designed to be mounted behind the steering neck, so regardless of the options they have to keep it level, it will never be on solid ground unless it's on a flat top tube - so, I would not put it on any of my bikes with slanted top tubes. I currently have two Topeka rear, rack mounted carriers and can say that they are the safest options available - they are cumbersome- but they work perfect on our bikes with slanted top tubes. The Co-Rider is no comparison in safety to the Topeka (shoulder harness holding my child snuggly into a safety seat comparable to a car seat versus a lap strap holding my child onto the top tube of my bike - uh), but it is a ton of fun! Also, I ditched the foot rests - they are very heavy and interfere with the turning radius. En lieu of the foot rests I picked up two stirrup style strap (Husky at Home Depot) and attached in the foot rest bolt holes via carabiner. I don't think we'll leave the road very often with this, but the setup feels very secure on flat land. The safety strap by the way does a nice job of keeping them on the saddle.

I finally broke down and bought a new one after not being able to find a used one.  I purchased this one because it seemed to be reasonably priced and it got good reviews.  I was a little nervous about it since some of the people that were petite said that it didn't fit them and that it was too big.  I'm 4'11\\"" and it fits me just fine so I am not sure what they are talking about.  I also didn't have any problems with it being too tight in the chest area too and I would say I'm a pretty average size.  Some of the reviews said that they need someone else to help them with the metal stand - I have not experienced that either.  My son is almost 17 months old and he is about 25 pounds and I can take him off of my back and open up the stand by myself.  It takes a bit of practice and some upper body strength but after carrying around a child in my arms for over 16 months I would say that I've built up my strength to handle an extra 5 or 6 pounds that comes from the carrier.  Right now I'm just starting off on short walks around the neighborhood - it does take a while to build up your muscles but it is comfortable and works great for me.  I love that it comes with the sun shade and the pockets that attach to it as well.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase and can't wait to hit the trails and lose this baby weight!",7/22/2011

It's worth the price (yes, compared to the cheaper door frame jumpers)!","A friend of ours got this for their little boy (same age as our baby) and seeing how happy he was sealed the deal on whether or not we wanted to fork over the money for it for our baby since it's much more expensive than the door frame jumpers (and larger space wise). My husband and I agree it's the best baby purchase we've made so far.<br /><br />Our daughter LOVES this thing so much. The first time we put her in it she lit up like a Christmas tree when she figured out she could jump up and down on her own, it was hysterical. She giggles and squeals and turns around and around, stopping only to smile at us or reach out to try and pet the dog as he goes by. Now she's figured out she can pivot on one foot to do a spin to face whatever direction she wants. A side benefit of her having a blast (and us having one watching her) is that we can sit down in front of her and eat in peace while she jumps to her heart's content. Obviously I highly recommend getting this but for those of you who like bullet points/pros/cons here they are:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to set up, no tools needed. Took me about 10 minutes to put together.<br />- Easy to fold back up and put away flat BUT you need to hang on to the washers so have a ziplock baggie and some tape handy. Not sure why they don't have a better way to store these onto the jumper so you don't lose them and can easily keep them close by.<br />- Very sturdy, no wondering if a door frame will hold it safely or if your baby is going to run/jump into a door<br />- Tons of fun for baby and parents/caregivers<br />- Quality materials; harness is washable (make sure you attach the velcro strips together before washing)<br />- Lightweight, easy to move to another area/room<br /><br />Cons:<br />- You need space for this thing. We have a pretty small living room and this thing takes up half the walkable space (but we don't care since we love it.)<br />- As another reviewer said, it's a pain to get your kid in and out of it, which sounds like a deal breaker but it's not. The instructions tell you to lay your baby down and put them in the harness and then, while holding your baby in the harness, hook the harness into the appropriate chain link. Um yeah...that's really hard to do the first time when you are not sure which chain link to hook it into because it all depends on your baby's height so it's trial and error and you're standing there holding your baby in the harness trying to match up the hook to the correct link and it's all just a giant pain. So...I recommend once you figure out which link to put it into, leave it there and just take your baby out of/put them in the harness while it's attached to the spring already. This is not super easy to do and you have to be careful but it's significantly easier than the other method of trying to rehook a harnessed baby (who, by the way, will start to get so excited they will start jumping before you even get them fully secured into the harness). It's definitely easier to do with two people, so one of you can hold the harness open and the other can easily put the baby in it but you can do it by yourself if you're patient and it gets easier every time. Again, this is not a deal breaker (for me) when it's such a great product.<br /><br />And of course, while this should go without saying, this is not a babysitter...you must watch your baby closely at all times while in this jumper and despite the product saying it's for babies 3 months and older your baby MUST have very good head control before using this, so it's more likely for use around 4 to 5 months, not 3. Also if your baby is already close to 30 lbs this product is probably not for you. We had friends come over with their 10 month old who is pretty chunky and we had to put the harness at the highest setting and he sunk so low he couldn't really jump so he just stood there and stared at us. So have it ready around 4 months so your baby can get full use of it. Oh and have your video camera ready!",3/30/2015

I feel compelled to write it because this is the best baby product ever!  Out of all of the baby gear that we bought and/or received as a gift, this is, hands down, the most useful for getting baby to sleep.  Our baby is now 6 weeks old and we have been using this for 2 weeks.  She loves it and sleeps in it every night.  We could not get her to sleep in her pack n play, a swing, or a bouncer for more than an hour or so, and last night she slept for a 5 1/2 hour stretch in her sleeper.  Our baby has reflux and the sleeper has also helped with this as we can now keep her somewhat upright after feedings.  The sleeper is also really helpful for moms who are pumping (such as myself) as you can rock baby to sleep with your foot while pumping or doing something else with your hands.  Finally, if you place the sleeper next to your bed, then you can gently rock baby back to sleep by hand in the middle of the night without getting out of bed.  This is HUGE bonus for exhausted, new parents.  I highly recommend this product.  It is much better than the swing or bouncer, so if you are on a budget and can only get one of these products, get this one.",6/6/2012

Happy Toddler!","I read reviews on this and many other bedding sets before purchasing.  My 2 1/2 yr old moved into a new big boy room as we're expecting our 2nd and we wanted to make his new crib/convertible bed special.  The colors are VERY vibrant and they did not fade at all in the washer or dryer.  Some comments from other reviewers included scratchy sheets and a large tag at the top of the blanket.  Both of these have been fixed by the manufacturer apparently, because the sheets are VERY soft (and I am picky about thread count... they're silky smooth).  The tags, while large, are at the bottom of the blanket, so you can either cut them off or tuck them into the bottom of the bed and they're completely out of the way.  The elastic at the bottom of the top sheet is a great idea, especially for toddlers that aren't used to having a pillow, top sheet, or large blanket on the bed.  He can't pull the sheet and twist it all over the bed, it will stay in place!  There are many other bedding options that cost double and I am so glad I tried this one first.  At this price, my toddler can change his mind about his room many times and for around $30, we can give him a whole new bedroom!

It is one of the single most useful baby products in the possession of anyone fortunate enough to acquire one -- the luxury sedan of eating accessories. <br /> <br />They are made of the same kind of waterproof polyester fabric that some shower liners are made from, but a bit more lightweight and breathable. <br /> <br />They may cost a little more than basic bibs, but they last a lot longer too, since they don't crack like a lot of the plastic bibs we had.

When I tore the first sheet off the roll, I instantly understood why they were cheaper.<br /><br />The sheets are smaller and they have a tendency to bunch/creep which means they only catch about 1/3 to 1/2 of the \\""output\\"". Most noticeably, they are extremely rough...I honestly felt bad about even putting them up against my child's bottom. He has never had diaper rash and is almost one year old, but he has developed a rash since using this product. I had taken him to the pediatrician earlier this week due to illness, and while I was there, I mentioned the rash. The doctor looked at it and said that it is most likely caused by friction/rubbing. With these being so stiff and scratchy, I wouldn't be surprised if these liners were a contributing factor as nothing else in our diaper routine has changed.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed in this product and will certainly never be purchasing it again. If you're looking for a good liner, stick with Bumkins flushable liners (100 count for $7.99). Bumkins are very soft, larger, stay-put, and completely serve their intended purpose. They are well worth the (very minimal) additional expense.",1/11/2013
